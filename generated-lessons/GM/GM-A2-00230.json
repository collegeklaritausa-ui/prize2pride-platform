  "content": "Welcome to your lesson on passive voice! In American English, the passive voice shifts the focus from who is doing the action to what is being done or who/what receives the action. It is formed with the verb 'to be' plus the past participle of the main verb.\n\nFor example, active: 'The dog chased the cat.' Passive: 'The cat was chased by the dog.'\n\nNotice how the focus is on 'the cat'—the receiver of the action. Passive voice is often used in formal writing, news reports, and when the doer is unknown or unimportant.\n\nTo form passive voice:\n1. Identify the object of the active sentence.\n2. Move the object to the subject position.\n3. Use the correct form of 'to be' (am, is, are, was, were) matching the tense.\n4. Add the past participle of the main verb.\n\nExample:\nActive: \"The chef cooks the meal.\"\nPassive: \"The meal is cooked by the chef.\"\n\nRemember, in elementary English, passive sentences are usually simple and straightforward. Practice transforming active sentences to passive to become a master of this form!",

While active voice is more common in everyday conversation, mastering passive voice gives you the flexibility to adapt your language to different contexts, especially in professional or academic settings.",
