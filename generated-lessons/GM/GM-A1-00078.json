  "content": "Welcome to the world of conditionals, a key part of mastering American English! Conditionals are sentences with 'if' that talk about real, possible, or imaginary situations.\n\n**Zero Conditional**: Used for facts and truths.\n- Structure: If + present simple, + present simple.\n- Example: If you freeze water, it turns into ice.\n\n**First Conditional**: Used for real future possibilities.\n- Structure: If + present simple, + will + base verb.\n- Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will cancel the picnic.\n\n**Second Conditional**: Used for hypothetical or unlikely situations.\n- Structure: If + past simple, + would + base verb.\n- Example: If I were a millionaire, I would buy a house.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n- Always match the tense with the type of conditional.\n- Use 'were' instead of 'was' in second conditional for all subjects.\n- Remember, 'will' is used for real future possibilities, while 'would' expresses hypothetical situations.\n\nBy mastering these structures, you'll be able to describe facts, future plans, and imaginary scenarios confidently in American English!",
