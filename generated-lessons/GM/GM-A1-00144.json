  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are essential tools that help us express different meanings such as ability, permission, obligation, and possibility. They are always followed by the base form of the main verb without 'to'.\n\nCommon modal verbs include: \n- Can (ability, permission)\n- Could (past ability, polite permission)\n- May (possibility, permission)\n- Might (less certain possibility)\n- Must (obligation, necessity)\n- Should (advice)\n- Will (future intention)\n- Would (polite requests, hypothetical situations)\n\nExamples:\n- I **can** swim.\n- **May** I leave early today?\n- You **must** wear a seatbelt.\n- She **should** see a doctor.\n- We **will** meet tomorrow.\n\nRemember, modal verbs do not change form for different subjects. For example:\n- I **can** help.\n- She **can** help.\n\nPractice using modal verbs to make your statements more confident and clear in American English.\n\nTip: Modal verbs are often used in questions and negative sentences as well. For example:\n- **Can** you help me?\n- You **cannot** park here.",

Saying 'May I' is considered polite, while 'Can I' is more informal. Using modal verbs correctly can help you sound more confident and respectful in American social and professional settings.",
