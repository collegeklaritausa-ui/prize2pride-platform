  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that add meaning to the main verb, indicating ability, possibility, permission, obligation, or advice. Mastering their use transforms your speech from mere communication to language mastery.\n\n**Core Modal Verbs and Their Functions:**\n- **Can:** Express ability or possibility.\n  *Example:* I can run a mile in six minutes.\n- **Could:** Past ability or polite possibility.\n  *Example:* When I was younger, I could climb trees.\n- **May & Might:** Formal or uncertain possibility.\n  *Example:* It may snow tomorrow.\n- **Must:** Strong obligation or certainty.\n  *Example:* You must wear a seatbelt.\n- **Should:** Advice or recommendation.\n  *Example:* You should try the new restaurant.\n- **Would:** Hypothetical situations or polite requests.\n  *Example:* I would help if I could.\n\n**Using Modal Verbs in Context:**\n- **Ability:** \"She can play the guitar.\"\n- **Permission:** \"May I borrow your car?\"\n- **Necessity:** \"You must submit the report by Friday.\"\n- **Possibility:** \"They might come to the party.\"\n- **Advice:** \"You should see a dentist.\"\n- **Politeness:** \"Would you like some coffee?\"\n\n**Note:** Modal verbs do not change form based on the subject. They are followed directly by the base form of the verb.\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n- Using modal verbs with 'to' (e.g., *must to go*) — incorrect.\n- Confusing 'can' and 'may' — 'can' for ability, 'may' for permission.\n- Overusing 'should' when 'must' is necessary.\n\n**Tip for Mastery:** Practice constructing sentences with each modal verb in various contexts to internalize their nuances and improve fluency.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, modal verbs are frequently used in polite requests and suggestions, reflecting the value placed on politeness and respect in communication. For instance, saying 'Could you help me?' instead of a direct command demonstrates courtesy. Understanding these nuances enhances social interactions and professional communication in the United States.",
