  "content": "Conjunctions are essential tools in American English that enable speakers and writers to connect ideas smoothly, creating more complex and nuanced sentences. Conjunctions can be classified into three main types:\n\n1. Coordinating Conjunctions: These join two equal grammatical elements. Remember the acronym FANBOYS:\n- For (reason)\n- And (addition)\n- Nor (negation)\n- But (contrast)\n- Or (choice)\n- Yet (contrast)\n- So (result)\n\nExample: I wanted to go for a walk, but it started raining.\n\n2. Subordinating Conjunctions: These introduce dependent clauses and show the relationship between the dependent and main clause. Common subordinating conjunctions include: because, since, although, while, if, when, unless, whereas.\n\nExample: She stayed home because she was feeling sick.\n\n3. Correlative Conjunctions: These work in pairs to connect equal elements. Examples include: either...or, neither...nor, both...and, not only...but also.\n\nExample: Not only did he finish his homework, but he also helped his sister.\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly enhances sentence variety and clarity. For example, instead of writing two separate sentences:\n\"It was raining. I stayed inside.\"\n\nYou can combine them with a conjunction:\n\"It was raining, so I stayed inside.\"\n\nPractice linking ideas with appropriate conjunctions to elevate your mastery of American English grammar and make your speech and writing more compelling.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, effective use of conjunctions reflects clarity and coherence in communication, which are highly valued in both academic and professional settings. Mastery of conjunctions enables speakers and writers to articulate ideas more convincingly, build persuasive arguments, and foster smooth conversations, especially in formal contexts such as business meetings, academic essays, and political debates. Understanding and employing proper conjunctions also demonstrates linguistic sophistication appreciated in American social and cultural interactions.",
