  "content": "Welcome to the world of verb tenses, the backbone of clear and accurate communication in American English. Mastering verb tenses allows you to specify when an action occurs—whether in the present, past, or future.\n\n**Present Tense:** Used for current actions or general truths. Example: 'She works at the bank.'\n\n**Past Tense:** Describes actions that happened previously. Regular verbs typically add '-ed' (e.g., 'walked'), while irregular verbs vary (e.g., 'went').\n\n**Future Tense:** Indicates actions that will happen. Usually formed with 'will' or 'be going to.' Example: 'They will visit tomorrow.'\n\n**Progressive (Continuous) Tenses:** Show ongoing actions. Present progressive: 'I am studying.' Past progressive: 'They were playing.' Future progressive: 'She will be working.'\n\n**Perfect Tenses:** Express completed actions. Present perfect: 'I have finished.' Past perfect: 'They had left.' Future perfect: 'By next year, I will have graduated.'\n\nUnderstanding the nuances of these tenses and their correct usage elevates your communication skills. Practice conjugating common regular and irregular verbs across different tenses to gain confidence.\n\nRemember, consistency is key to mastering verb tenses. Keep practicing to become a true GOD of American English!",
