Today, we focus on conditionals, which are sentences that tell us about real or imaginary situations.\n\n**Zero Conditional:** Used for facts and routines.\n- Structure: If + present simple, present simple.\n- Example: If you heat ice, it melts.\n\n**First Conditional:** Used for real future possibilities.\n- Structure: If + present simple, will + base verb.\n- Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will stay home.\n\n**Second Conditional:** Used for hypothetical or unlikely situations.\n- Structure: If + past simple, would + base verb.\n- Example: If I had a million dollars, I would buy a house.\n\nBy mastering these patterns, you can talk about facts, plans, and imaginary worlds in American English. Remember, practice makes perfect!\n\nLet's move on to some examples:\n- Zero: If you study hard, you learn a lot.\n- First: If you arrive early, you get a good seat.\n- Second: If I were taller, I could play basketball.\n\nNow, try creating your own sentences using each type of conditional.
