  "content": "Modal verbs are special words used alongside main verbs to express ideas such as ability, permission, possibility, or obligation. They do not change form based on the subject and are followed by the base form of the main verb.\n\nFor example:\n- Ability: \"She can swim.\"\n- Permission: \"May I leave early?\"\n- Possibility: \"It might snow tomorrow.\"\n\nCommon modal verbs in American English include can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, and would.\n\nUsing these modal verbs correctly helps you sound more natural and fluent. Here are some tips:\n- Use \"can\" to show ability or possibility.\n- Use \"may\" or \"might\" to ask or give permission and to express uncertain possibility.\n- Use \"must\" for obligations or strong recommendations.\n\nExample sentences:\n- I can speak three languages.\n- May I sit here?\n- You must wear a seatbelt.\n- It might be cold outside.\n\nRemember, modal verbs are followed by the base form of the main verb. For example, \"can go,\" not \"can goes.\"",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, polite requests often involve modal verbs like 'may' or 'could.' When asking for permission, Americans typically say 'May I...' instead of 'Can I...' as it is considered more formal and polite. Understanding modal verbs enhances your ability to communicate effectively and respectfully in various social situations across the United States.",
