Mastering these is essential for clear communication.\n\n1. **Simple Present**\n- Use it to describe routines, facts, or general truths.\n- Example: 'I eat breakfast every morning.'\n- Common expressions: always, never, usually, sometimes.\n\n2. **Simple Past**\n- Use it for actions completed in the past.\n- Example: 'She visited New York last summer.'\n- Signal words: yesterday, last week, ago.\n\n3. **Simple Future**\n- Use it to talk about what will happen.\n- Example: 'We will see the movie tomorrow.'\n- Signal words: tomorrow, next week, in the future.\n\n**Tip:** Remember, in American English, contractions are common: 'I will' becomes 'I'll', 'You will' becomes 'You'll', 'He will' becomes 'He'll'.\n\nBy mastering these tenses and their uses, you'll be able to speak about yesterday, today, and tomorrow with confidence—your first step toward American English mastery!",
