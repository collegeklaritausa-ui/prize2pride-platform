  "content": "Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that provide additional meaning to the main verb, expressing ideas such as ability, possibility, permission, obligation, or necessity. They do not change form according to the subject and are always followed by the base form of the main verb.\n\nCommon modal verbs include: can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, and would.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Ability: **She can** speak three languages.\n- Permission: **May** I leave early today?\n- Obligation: You **must** finish your homework.\n- Advice: You **should** see a doctor.\n- Possibility: It **might** snow tonight.\n\n**Using Modal Verbs in Context:**\nIn American English, modal verbs are often used to express attitudes, politeness, and social norms. For example, using **can** or **may** to politely ask for permission shows respect.\n\n**Modality Nuances:**\n- **Can** is used for ability and informal permission.\n- **May** is more formal for permission.\n- **Must** indicates strong necessity or obligation.\n- **Should** offers advice or recommendation.\n\nUnderstanding the subtle differences helps you communicate more effectively in diverse situations across American social and professional settings.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, modal verbs reflect social norms of politeness and directness. For example, Americans often use 'can' or 'may' when requesting permission, emphasizing respect and politeness. Additionally, the use of 'must' in legal or formal contexts signifies strict obligation, common in workplace and legal communications. Understanding these nuances helps non-native speakers navigate social interactions smoothly and demonstrates cultural awareness in language usage.",
