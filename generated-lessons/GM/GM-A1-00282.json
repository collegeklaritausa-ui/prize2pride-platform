  "content": "Welcome to the lesson on Reported Speech! In American English, reported speech helps you share what someone said without repeating their exact words. It is very useful in conversations, interviews, and storytelling. \n\n**Direct Speech** uses quotation marks to show the exact words spoken. For example: \"I'm going shopping,\" she said.\n\n**Reported Speech** transforms those words into a form that reports what was said, often changing pronouns, verb tenses, and time references. For example: She said she was going shopping.\n\n**Steps to convert direct speech to reported speech:**\n1. Remove the quotation marks.\n2. Change the pronouns if needed (I → she/he, my → her/his).\n3. Shift the verb tense back in time (present to past, present perfect to past perfect).\n4. Adjust time and place references (today → that day, now → then).\n\n**Example Conversion:**\n- Direct: He said, \"I will call you tomorrow.\"\n- Reported: He said he would call me the next day.\n\nPractice these patterns to become more fluent and natural in your American English conversations!",
