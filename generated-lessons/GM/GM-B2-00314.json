  "content": "In American English, reported speech is used to relay what someone else has said, often in indirect form. To transform direct speech into reported speech, follow these key rules:\n\n1. **Tense Shift:** Usually, the tense shifts back in time:\n   - Present simple → Past simple\n   - Present continuous → Past continuous\n   - Present perfect → Past perfect\n   - Past simple → Past perfect\n\n   *Example:* She said, 'I am hungry.' → She said she was hungry.\n\n2. **Pronoun Adjustment:** Change the pronouns to fit the reporting perspective:\n\n   *Example:* He said, 'I will visit you.' → He said he would visit me.\n\n3. **Time and Place Expressions:** Adjust expressions to match the reporting context:\n\n   *Example:* 'Today' becomes 'that day,' 'tomorrow' becomes 'the next day,' 'here' becomes 'there.'\n\n   *Example:* She said, 'I will see you here tomorrow.' → She said she would see me there the next day.\n\n4. **Questions and Commands:** For questions, use if or whether for yes/no questions and switch word order for wh-questions. For commands, use infinitives with 'told' or 'asked.'\n\n   *Examples:* \n   - Direct question: 'Are you coming?'\n   - Reported: She asked if I was coming.\n\n   - Command: 'Close the door.'\n   - Reported: He told me to close the door.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n- Always identify the tense, pronoun, and time expressions in the original speech.\n- Practice converting sentences in different contexts for mastery.\n- Pay attention to the context to choose appropriate reporting verbs like 'say,' 'tell,' 'ask,' 'advise.'\n\nUsing reported speech accurately helps you sound more natural and confident in both spoken and written American English, especially in formal and informal contexts.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, direct and indirect communication styles are prevalent. Americans often value clarity and politeness, especially in formal contexts. Using reported speech appropriately demonstrates respect and professionalism. In casual conversations, Americans may use reported speech more flexibly, sometimes omitting certain adjustments, but mastering the rules ensures clarity in all situations. Understanding time expressions is particularly important, as Americans often refer to future plans with specific days or times, so adjusting these in reported speech is essential for effective communication.",
