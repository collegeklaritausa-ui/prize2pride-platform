  "content": "Welcome to your journey to becoming a GOD of American English! Today, we focus on the basics of verb tenses: the simple present and simple past. These tenses help you talk about what you do regularly and what you did previously.\n\n**Simple Present Tense:**\nUse this tense for routines, facts, and general truths.\n- Structure: Subject + base verb (add 's' or 'es' for third person singular)\n- Example: I eat breakfast at 7 am. / She works in a bank.\n- Common time expressions: always, usually, every day, often, sometimes.\n\n**Simple Past Tense:**\nUse this tense for actions completed in the past.\n- Structure: Subject + past form of the verb\n- Example: I watched a movie last night. / They visited New York.\n- Common time expressions: yesterday, last year, ago, in 2010.\n\n**Tips to remember:**\n- For regular verbs, add '-ed' to form the past tense.\n- Irregular verbs have unique past forms (e.g., go → went, have → had).\n\nPractice makes perfect! Use these tenses to tell stories about your daily life or past experiences. The more you practice, the more natural your sentences will become, making you a true GOD of American English!\n\nLet's move on to some practical exercises to master these tenses.",
