  "content": "Welcome to your journey to mastering basic sentence structure in American English! A sentence is the foundation of clear communication. Every complete sentence has two main parts: the subject and the predicate. The subject tells us **who** or **what** the sentence is about, while the predicate explains **what** the subject does or is.\n\nFor example:\n- **Subject:** The teacher\n- **Predicate:** explains the lesson.\n\nPutting it together: **The teacher explains the lesson.**\n\nIn beginner sentences, the typical order is Subject + Verb + (Object). For example:\n- I (subject) like (verb) pizza (object).\n- The dog (subject) runs (verb).\n\nRemember, a complete sentence must express a full thought. Avoid fragments like \"Running late\" or \"Because I said so,\" unless they are part of a larger sentence.\n\nPractice constructing sentences by starting with a subject, then adding a verb and other details. This simple structure will help you communicate clearly and confidently in American English!",
