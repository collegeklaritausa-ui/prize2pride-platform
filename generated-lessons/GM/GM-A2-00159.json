  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are essential for expressing ability, permission, possibility, obligation, and future plans. They are used alongside base verbs without 'to'. For example:\n\n- Ability: \"She can play the piano.\"\n- Permission: \"May I leave early?\"\n- Possibility: \"It might snow tomorrow.\"\n- Obligation: \"You must wear a seatbelt.\"\n- Future intention: \"I will call you later.\"\n\nCommon modal verbs include can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, and would. Each has specific uses:\n\n- 'Can' and 'could' express ability or possibility.\n- 'May' and 'might' indicate permission or possibility.\n- 'Must' shows necessity or obligation.\n- 'Shall' and 'will' refer to future actions or promises.\n- 'Should' offers advice or recommendations.\n\nRemember, modal verbs are followed directly by the base form of the main verb:\n\n- Correct: \"She can sing.\"\n- Incorrect: \"She can to sing.\"\n\nUsing modal verbs correctly will make your sentences clearer and more natural in American English.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, using modal verbs correctly can help you sound polite and confident. For example, saying 'May I' when asking for permission shows respect, which is appreciated in American social interactions. Additionally, Americans often use 'will' to express future intentions casually, as in 'I'll see you tomorrow,' reflecting a friendly and informal tone.",
