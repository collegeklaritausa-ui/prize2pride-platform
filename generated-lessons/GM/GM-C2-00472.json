  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, prepositions are often used idiomatically, such as 'look after' (to take care of), 'deal with' (to handle), and 'come from' (origin). Mastery of these expressions enhances both comprehension and natural communication. Additionally, Americans value directness, so precise use of prepositions can make your speech clearer and more impactful in social and professional settings.",
