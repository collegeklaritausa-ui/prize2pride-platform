  "content": "Welcome to your lesson on the Passive Voice! In American English, the passive voice is a way to focus on the action or the receiver of the action rather than the doer. For example, instead of saying 'John painted the wall,' you can say 'The wall was painted by John.'\n\nForming the passive voice involves two main steps:\n1. Use the correct form of the verb 'to be' based on the tense.\n2. Add the past participle of the main verb.\n\nExamples:\n- Present Simple: The cookie is made daily.\n- Past Simple: The homework was completed by the students.\n- Future: The project will be finished tomorrow.\n\nPassive voice is especially useful when the doer is unknown, unimportant, or obvious. For instance, \"The window was broken\" doesn't specify who broke it.\n\nRemember, overusing passive voice can make sentences seem vague or impersonal. Use it wisely to enhance clarity and emphasis in your communication.",

Passive voice is often used in formal writing, news reports, and professional settings to maintain objectivity or focus on the action rather than the actor. Understanding when and how to use passive voice can help you sound more polished and culturally aware in your English usage.",
