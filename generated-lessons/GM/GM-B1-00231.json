  "content": "Welcome to the realm of American English mastery! Today, we delve into the passive voice—a powerful grammatical tool that shifts focus from the doer to the action or recipient. In active voice, the subject performs the action: 'The chef cooked the meal.' In passive voice, the focus shifts to the action or the object receiving it: 'The meal was cooked by the chef.' \n\n**Structure of Passive Voice:**\n- For most tenses, the passive voice follows this pattern:\n  **be** + past participle of the main verb.\n- Example in present simple: 'The documents are prepared by the staff.'\n- Example in past perfect: 'The problem had been solved by the technician.'\n\n**When to Use the Passive Voice:**\n- When the doer is unknown or unimportant:\n  - 'The window was broken during the storm.'\n- To emphasize the action or recipient:\n  - 'The novel was written in 1920.'\n- In formal or scientific writing:\n  - 'The experiment was conducted over three days.'\n\n**Transforming Active to Passive:**\n- Identify the object, make it the subject.\n- Use the correct form of 'be' matching the tense.\n- Add the past participle.\n- Optionally, include the original subject preceded by 'by'.\n\n**Example Transformations:**\n- Active: 'The students completed the project.'\n- Passive: 'The project was completed by the students.'\n\nBy mastering the passive voice, you'll add versatility and precision to your American English, making your communication more impactful and sophisticated.",
