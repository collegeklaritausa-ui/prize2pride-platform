  "content": "Welcome to your journey to becoming a GOD of American English grammar! Today, we focus on prepositions—small words with big power. Prepositions tell us where, when, or how something happens. For example, in the sentence 'The ball is **in** the box,' the word 'in' shows where the ball is.\n\nCommon prepositions include 'in,' 'on,' 'at,' 'under,' 'over,' 'between,' 'to,' 'from,' and 'with.' These words help create clear and precise sentences. \n\nLet's look at some examples:\n- Location: The keys are **on** the table.\n- Direction: She is going **to** the store.\n- Time: The meeting is **at** 5 o'clock.\n\nRemember, prepositions are usually followed by a noun or pronoun, called the object of the preposition. For example, in 'The dog sleeps **under** the bed,' 'under' is the preposition, and 'the bed' is its object.\n\nPractice using prepositions in your own sentences to improve your mastery. With time and practice, you'll be unstoppable in your American English skills!",
