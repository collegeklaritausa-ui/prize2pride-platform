  "content": "Welcome to your journey toward mastering American English sentence structure! A sentence is the building block of communication. In simple sentences, the most common pattern is Subject + Verb + Object. For example, 'I eat apples.' Here, 'I' is the subject, 'eat' is the verb (action), and 'apples' is the object. To create clear and correct sentences:\n\n1. Start with a subject (who or what the sentence is about).\n2. Add a verb (what the subject does).\n3. Include an object if needed (who or what receives the action).\n\nExamples:\n- 'You play soccer.'\n- 'The teacher explains the lesson.'\n- 'They watch movies.'\n\nRemember, every complete sentence must have at least a subject and a verb. As you practice, pay attention to the order of words and ensure each sentence expresses a complete thought. Using these basic structures will make your American English clear and effective!",
