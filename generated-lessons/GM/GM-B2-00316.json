  "content": "Reported speech is a crucial aspect of American English, allowing speakers to relay information conveyed by others. When transforming direct quotations into reported speech, several key rules apply:\n\n1. **Tense Shift:** Usually, present tense changes to past tense, past tense may shift further back, and perfect tenses may change accordingly.\n   - Example: \"I am busy,\" she said. → She said that she was busy.\n\n2. **Pronoun Adjustment:** Pronouns are changed to match the perspective of the reporter.\n   - Example: \"I will call you,\" he said. → He said that he would call me.\n\n3. **Time and Place Expressions:** Words indicating time and place often change to reflect the new context.\n   - Example: \"Today\" becomes \"that day,\" \"here\" becomes \"there.\"\n\n4. **Reporting Verbs:** Common verbs include 'say,' 'tell,' 'explain,' 'mention.' Use 'tell' when a specific object or person is involved.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: John said, \"I will meet you at the park.\"\n- Reported: John said that he would meet me at the park.\n\nIn informal American English, contractions are common in spoken reported speech, such as 'she's' for 'she is' or 'they're' for 'they are.'\n\nPractice transforming direct speech into reported speech to master this skill and speak confidently like a true American English GOD!",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, informal conversations often feature contractions and relaxed language, especially when reporting speech in everyday situations. Americans value clarity and directness, so when practicing reported speech, it's important to adapt formal and informal tones appropriately. In cultural contexts like business meetings or interviews, precise tense and pronoun adjustments are essential for professionalism. Understanding the nuances of reported speech enhances your ability to participate effectively in American social and professional interactions.",
