  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that add meaning to the main verb, indicating ability, permission, obligation, advice, or possibility. They are unique because they do not change form according to the subject and are followed directly by the base form of the main verb.\n\nFor example:\n- Ability: \"She can speak three languages.\"\n- Permission: \"May I leave early today?\" (Note: 'May' is more formal, but 'can' is commonly used for permission in informal contexts.)\n- Obligation: \"You must wear a seatbelt.\"\n- Possibility: \"They might arrive late.\"\n- Advice: \"You should try the new restaurant.\"\n\nDifferent modal verbs carry different shades of meaning:\n- 'Can' and 'could' often relate to ability and possibility.\n- 'May' and 'might' are used to express possibility or permission.\n- 'Must' indicates obligation or necessity.\n- 'Should' is used for advice or recommendations.\n\nIt’s important to recognize that some modal verbs have similar functions but different degrees of formality or certainty. For example, 'may' and 'might' both indicate possibility, but 'may' suggests a higher likelihood.\n\nIn American English, modal verbs are crucial for polite requests, giving advice, and expressing necessity or possibility. Mastering their use will elevate your fluency and sophistication in everyday conversations.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, using modal verbs appropriately shows politeness and respect, especially when making requests or giving advice. For example, Americans often use 'could' and 'would' to soften requests, reflecting a culture of friendliness and consideration. Understanding the nuance between 'must' and 'should' also helps in communicating obligation versus suggestion, which is important in professional and casual contexts in the U.S.",
