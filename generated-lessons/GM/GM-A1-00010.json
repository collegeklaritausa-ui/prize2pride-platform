  "content": "Welcome to Lesson #10: Verb Tenses! Today, we will learn how to talk about actions in the present, past, and future — the foundation of clear communication in American English.\n\n**1. Present Tense:**\nUse the present tense to describe routines, facts, and general truths.\n- Example: 'I eat breakfast at 7 am.'\n- Formation: Base form of the verb for most subjects (I, you, we, they); add 's' or 'es' for he, she, it (e.g., 'He works').\n\n**2. Past Tense:**\nUse the past tense for actions completed in the past.\n- Regular verbs add '-ed' (walk → walked).\n- Irregular verbs change form (go → went; see → saw).\n- Example: 'We watched a movie yesterday.'\n\n**3. Future Tense:**\nUse 'will' + base verb to talk about the future.\n- Example: 'She will visit her friend tomorrow.'\n- Formation: Subject + will + verb.\n\n**Tip:** Consistent use of tenses helps others understand when actions happen. Practice regularly to become confident!\n\n**Examples in Sentences:**\n- Present: 'I drive to work every day.'\n- Past: 'I drove to work yesterday.'\n- Future: 'I will drive to work tomorrow.'\n\nRemember, mastering these tenses makes your communication clear and effective. Keep practicing these forms in your daily conversations!",
