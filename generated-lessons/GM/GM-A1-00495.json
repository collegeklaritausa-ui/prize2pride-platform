  "content": "Conjunctions are essential tools in American English that help us connect words, phrases, and clauses to make our sentences clearer and more interesting. There are two main types of conjunctions:\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions**: These join equal parts of a sentence. The most common are **and**, **but**, **or**, **nor**, **for**, **yet**, and **so**. \n\n   - Example: I want pizza **and** pasta.\n   - Example: She is tired **but** happy.\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions**: These connect a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing a relationship like cause, time, or condition.\n\n   - Example: I stayed home **because** it was raining.\n   - Example: **When** he arrived, everyone was happy.\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly makes your speaking and writing more natural and fluent. Try combining simple sentences:\n\n- I like coffee. I drink it every morning.\n\nWith a conjunction:\n\n- I like coffee **and** I drink it every morning.\n\nOr:\n\n- I wanted to go out, **but** it was too cold.\n\nRemember, mastering conjunctions helps you build stronger sentences and express complex ideas effectively!",
