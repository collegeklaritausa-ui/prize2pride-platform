  "content": "Prepositions are small words that connect nouns or pronouns to other parts of a sentence, providing important details about location, time, or movement. In American English, prepositions are essential for clear and precise communication. Common prepositions include 'in', 'on', 'at', 'by', 'with', 'about', 'for', 'to', 'from', and 'over'.\n\nFor example:\n- Location: 'The cat is in the box.'\n- Time: 'The meeting is at 3 o'clock.'\n- Movement: 'He is going to the store.'\n\nUsing prepositions correctly helps you describe where things are, when events happen, and how actions are performed. Practice paying attention to prepositions in daily conversations and written texts to become more confident.\n\nRemember, some prepositions are used with specific words or expressions, so familiarizing yourself with common phrases will improve your mastery.",
