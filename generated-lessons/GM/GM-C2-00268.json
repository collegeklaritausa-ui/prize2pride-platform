  "content": "The passive voice is a fundamental aspect of English grammar where the focus shifts from the doer of an action to the receiver of that action. In American English, passive constructions are frequently used in formal writing, news reporting, and scientific documentation to emphasize the action or the recipient rather than the actor.\n\n**Structure of Passive Voice:**\n- **Active:** Subject + verb + object\n- **Passive:** Object + form of 'to be' + past participle + (by + agent)\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The chef cooked the meal.\n- Passive: The meal was cooked by the chef.\n\n**Tense Transformations:**\n- Present: The manager reviews the reports. → The reports are reviewed by the manager.\n- Past: She completed the project. → The project was completed by her.\n- Future: They will approve the plan. → The plan will be approved by them.\n\n**Converting Active to Passive:**\n1. Move the object of the active sentence to the subject position.\n2. Use the appropriate form of 'to be' for the tense.\n3. Add the past participle of the main verb.\n4. (Optional) Add 'by' + original subject.\n\n**Important Tips:**\n- Not all active sentences can be converted into passive (especially intransitive verbs).\n- Passive voice often makes sentences more formal and impersonal.\n- Overusing passive voice can lead to vague or wordy writing; use it judiciously.\n\nMastery of passive constructions will elevate your command over American English, allowing you to write more formally and understand complex texts with ease.",
