  "content": "In American English, sentence structure is fundamental to clear and effective communication. Sentences are built from clauses, which are groups of words containing a subject and a predicate. Understanding the types of sentences helps you vary your language for clarity and emphasis.\n\n**Simple sentences** are straightforward, containing only one independent clause. For example, 'The dog barked.'\n\n**Compound sentences** connect two independent clauses with coordinating conjunctions like and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet. For example, 'I wanted coffee, but the store was closed.'\n\n**Complex sentences** include one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. For example, 'Although it was raining, we went hiking.'\n\n**Compound-complex sentences** combine elements of compound and complex sentences, with two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause. For example, 'While I was cooking, the phone rang, and I answered it.'\n\nEffective sentence structure involves proper punctuation, clause placement, and variety to avoid monotony. Mastering these structures allows you to express ideas more precisely and persuasively.\n\nRemember, understanding how to construct different sentence types is key to mastering American English grammar and becoming a confident communicator.",
