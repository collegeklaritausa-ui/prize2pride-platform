  "content": "Welcome to the pinnacle of American English mastery—your journey through verb tenses! To become a GOD of American English, you must command the full spectrum of verb forms, from simple to perfect, progressive to perfect progressive, across past, present, and future. \n\n**1. Simple Tenses:**\n- Present: Indicate habitual actions or general truths. e.g., 'He eats breakfast every morning.'\n- Past: Describe completed actions. e.g., 'They watched a movie yesterday.'\n- Future: Express upcoming actions. e.g., 'I will call you tomorrow.'\n\n**2. Progressive (Continuous) Tenses:**\n- Present Progressive: Actions happening now. e.g., 'She is reading a book.'\n- Past Progressive: Actions ongoing in the past. e.g., 'They were playing soccer.'\n- Future Progressive: Actions that will be ongoing. e.g., 'I will be traveling next week.'\n\n**3. Perfect Tenses:**\n- Present Perfect: Actions completed recently or with relevance now. e.g., 'He has finished his homework.'\n- Past Perfect: Actions completed before another past action. e.g., 'She had left before I arrived.'\n- Future Perfect: Actions that will be completed before a future time. e.g., 'By next year, I will have graduated.'\n\n**4. Perfect Progressive Tenses:**\n- Present Perfect Progressive: Duration of an ongoing action. e.g., 'They have been studying for hours.'\n- Past Perfect Progressive: Duration before a past point. e.g., 'He had been working all day.'\n- Future Perfect Progressive: Duration leading up to a future point. e.g., 'By then, she will have been living here for five years.'\n\nRemember, mastery involves not just knowing these forms but using them accurately and naturally. Practice by constructing sentences using each tense, paying close attention to context and time references.\n\nNow, let your mastery shine—become a GOD of American English verb tenses!",
