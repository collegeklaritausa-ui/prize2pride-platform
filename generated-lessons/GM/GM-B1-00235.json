  "content": "The passive voice is a fundamental aspect of American English grammar, used to shift focus from the doer of an action to the action itself or its recipient. It is especially common in formal writing, news reporting, and situations where the agent is unknown or unimportant.\n\n**Understanding Passive Voice:**\nIn an active sentence, the subject performs the action: 'The chef cooked the meal.' In passive voice, the object becomes the subject: 'The meal was cooked by the chef.'\n\n**Forming the Passive Voice:**\n- Use the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' based on the tense.\n- Follow with the past participle of the main verb.\n- Optionally include the agent preceded by 'by.'\n\n**Examples:**\n- Present Simple: The company *releases* new products. → New products *are released* by the company.\n- Past Simple: The teacher *graded* the exams. → The exams *were graded* by the teacher.\n- Future Simple: They *will build* a new park. → A new park *will be built* by them.\n\n**Notes:**\n- Not all sentences can or should be converted into passive voice.\n- Overuse of passive voice can make writing less direct or clear, so use it judiciously.\n- Recognize passive voice in context, especially in formal, scientific, or journalistic writing.\n\nBy mastering the passive voice, you can add variety and clarity to your communication, making you a true GOD of American English grammar.",
