  "content": "In American English, reported speech is used to relay what someone else has said without quoting them directly. It transforms a direct quote into a more narrative form. For example, direct speech: 'I am coming,' becomes reported speech: She said that she was coming.\n\nKey points to master:\n- When converting direct speech to reported speech, tense typically shifts back one step in time (present to past, past perfect to past perfect, etc.).\n- Pronouns often need to be changed to reflect the perspective of the speaker.\n- Reporting verbs like 'say,' 'tell,' 'ask,' 'explain,' etc., are used to introduce the reported speech.\n\nExample conversions:\n1. Direct: 'I will visit you tomorrow,' she said.\n   Reported: She said that she would visit me the next day.\n2. Direct: 'Do you like coffee?' he asked.\n   Reported: He asked if I liked coffee.\n\nRemember:\n- Use 'that' to connect the reporting clause with the reported speech, but it can often be omitted in informal American English.\n- Questions in direct speech are transformed into statement form in reported speech, often starting with 'if' or 'whether.'\n\nPractice converting sentences to solidify your understanding and become a true GOD of American English reported speech!",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, direct and indirect communication styles are both common. Americans tend to appreciate clarity and politeness, especially when reporting or relaying information. Using reported speech appropriately can help you communicate more effectively in professional and casual contexts, such as business meetings, interviews, and everyday conversations. Mastery of this grammatical aspect reflects confidence and respect in your communication skills, aligning with the value Americans place on clear articulation of ideas.",
