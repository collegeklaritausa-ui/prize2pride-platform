  "content": "Conjunctions are essential tools in American English that help us connect ideas, add complexity, and improve the flow of our speech and writing. Understanding the different types of conjunctions allows you to craft sentences that are clear, concise, and expressive.\n\n**1. Coordinating Conjunctions:**\nThese conjunctions join words or groups of words of equal importance. They are often remembered by the acronym FANBOYS:\n- **For**: Explains reason\n- **And**: Adds information\n- **But**: Shows contrast\n- **Or**: Presents an alternative\n- **Nor**: Presents a negative alternative\n- **Yet**: Introduces a contrast\n- **So**: Shows result\n\n*Example:* I wanted to go to the park, but it started raining.\n\n**2. Subordinating Conjunctions:**\nThese introduce subordinate clauses and show the relationship between clauses. Common subordinators include:\n- Because, although, since, unless, while, after, before, when\n\n*Example:* She stayed home because she was feeling sick.\n\n**3. Correlative Conjunctions:**\nPaired words that work together for emphasis or balance.\nExamples include:\n- Either...or\n- Neither...nor\n- Both...and\n- Not only...but also\n\n*Example:* You can either stay here or come with us.\n\n**Combining Conjunctions:**\nUse conjunctions effectively to create complex and compound sentences that enhance your language mastery.\n\n**Tips for Mastery:**\n- Avoid run-on sentences by using the correct conjunctions.\n- Practice varying sentence structures by mixing different types of conjunctions.\n- Pay attention to punctuation: Use a comma before coordinating conjunctions when connecting independent clauses.\n\nBy mastering conjunctions, you'll be able to connect ideas smoothly and express yourself more confidently in American English.",
