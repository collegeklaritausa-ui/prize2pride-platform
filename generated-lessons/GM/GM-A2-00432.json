  "content": "Welcome to the world of prepositions, the small words that make big differences in American English! Prepositions connect nouns and pronouns to other parts of the sentence, providing important information about location, direction, time, and more.\n\nCommon prepositions include: in, on, at, under, over, through, to, from, with, about.\n\nExamples:\n- Location: The dog is under the table.\n- Direction: We are going to the mall.\n- Time: The meeting is at 3 PM.\n\nRemember, choosing the right preposition helps your sentences sound natural and clear. Practice with these examples:\n- The pictures are on the wall.\n- She walked through the park.\n- He is from New York.\n\nUsing prepositions correctly is a key step toward becoming a master of American English. Keep practicing to make your sentences precise and expressive!",
