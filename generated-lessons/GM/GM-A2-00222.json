  "content": "Welcome to your first lesson in mastering the passive voice! In American English, sentences can be written in two ways: active and passive. In active sentences, the subject does the action. For example, 'The dog chased the ball.' Here, 'the dog' is doing the chasing. In passive sentences, the focus is on the action being done to the subject. For example, 'The ball was chased by the dog.' To create a passive sentence, follow these steps:\n\n1. Take the object of the active sentence and make it the subject.\n2. Use the correct form of the verb 'to be' + the past participle of the main verb.\n\nExamples:\n- Active: The teacher explains the lesson.\n- Passive: The lesson is explained by the teacher.\n\nRemember, passive voice is often used when the doer of the action is unknown, unimportant, or implied.\n\nLet's practice transforming sentences from active to passive voice with some simple examples. Practice makes perfect!",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, passive voice is often used in formal writing, news reports, and when the focus is on the action rather than the doer. For example, in news headlines, you might see: 'The house was robbed overnight.' Understanding and using passive voice helps you sound more natural and versatile in both speaking and writing American English.",
