  "content": "Welcome to your journey toward mastering conjunctions! In American English, conjunctions are little words that help link parts of sentences, making your language flow smoothly. Think of them as bridges connecting ideas.\n\nThe most common coordinating conjunctions are and, but, or, so, and yet. For example:\n- I like apples and oranges.\n- He is tall but friendly.\n- Do you want tea or coffee?\n- It was raining, so we stayed inside.\n- She was tired, yet she kept working.\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly allows you to combine simple ideas into more complex and interesting sentences. Practice using these words to connect thoughts and express yourself clearly. For example, instead of saying, 'I like pizza. I like salad,' you can say, 'I like pizza and salad.'\n\nRemember, conjunctions are your tools for making your speech and writing more natural and engaging. Keep practicing to become a true GOD of American English!",

Mastering conjunctions helps you sound natural and confident in daily interactions, whether you're chatting with friends, ordering food, or sharing stories.",
