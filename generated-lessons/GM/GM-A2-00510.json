  "content": "Welcome to your lesson on conjunctions, the essential connectors in English! Conjunctions help us join words, phrases, and clauses, making our sentences more interesting and easier to understand.\n\nThere are three main types of conjunctions:\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions**: These connect words or groups of words that are of equal importance. The most common are **and**, **but**, and **or**.\n\n   - Example: I like apples **and** oranges.\n   - Example: She is tall **but** her brother is short.\n   - Example: Do you want tea **or** coffee?\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions**: These connect a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing cause, contrast, time, etc.\n\n   - Example: I stayed home **because** it was raining.\n   - Example: **Although** he was tired, he finished his homework.\n   - Example: We will go **after** school.\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions**: These come in pairs and connect equal parts.\n\n   - Example: **Either** you come **or** stay home.\n   - Example: **Neither** the blue shirt **nor** the red one fits.\n   - Example: She is **both** talented **and** hardworking.\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly helps your sentences flow smoothly and express your ideas clearly. Practice combining sentences with conjunctions to improve your fluency!\n",
