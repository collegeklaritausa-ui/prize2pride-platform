  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, prepositions often appear in idiomatic expressions and colloquial phrases that reflect everyday life, such as 'out of the blue' or 'in charge of.' Understanding these expressions will help you sound more natural and engaged in American conversations. Additionally, the American emphasis on punctuality makes prepositions of time like 'at,' 'on,' and 'in' especially important for scheduling and punctuality. Paying attention to these nuances will not only improve your grammar but also deepen your understanding of American social norms and communication styles.",
