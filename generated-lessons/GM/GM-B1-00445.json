  "content": "Prepositions are small words that pack a punch—they connect nouns or pronouns to other words in a sentence, establishing relationships such as location, direction, time, or method. Mastery of prepositions is essential for clear, natural communication in American English.\n\nFor example, consider the sentence: 'The keys are **on** the table.' Here, 'on' shows the relationship between 'keys' and 'table', indicating location.\n\nCommon prepositions include: **in, on, at, by, with, about, for, from, to, of, under, over, between, during**. Each preposition has specific uses:\n- **In** indicates something inside a space or period.\n- **On** signifies a surface.\n- **At** points to a specific location or time.\n\nPrepositions are often part of prepositional phrases, which add detail:\n- 'She arrived **after the meeting**.'\n- 'He sat **next to his brother**.'\n\nUnderstanding the object of a preposition—the noun or pronoun that follows it—is crucial. For example, in 'The gift is **for her**,' 'her' is the object.\n\nRemember, prepositions often have multiple meanings and uses, so context is key. Practice identifying and using prepositions correctly to sound more fluent and natural in American English.",

  "culturalNotes": "Prepositions in American English are integral to everyday conversation, from giving directions ('Turn **left at** the corner') to describing routines ('I wake up **at** 7 AM'). Americans often use prepositions idiomatically; for example, 'on time' instead of 'in time.' Understanding prepositional phrases can also help in grasping American cultural references, such as sports ('He hit a home run **in** the ninth inning') and social interactions ('Meet me **at** the park'). Mastery of prepositions will help students navigate both formal and informal settings with confidence and authenticity.",
