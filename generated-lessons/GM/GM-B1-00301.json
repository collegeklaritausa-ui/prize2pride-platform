  "content": "Reported speech is a fundamental aspect of American English that allows you to convey what someone else has said, often used in storytelling, news, and everyday conversations. Unlike direct speech, which quotes the exact words, reported speech paraphrases the statement and usually involves changes in tense, pronouns, and time expressions.\n\n**Key points:**\n- When transforming direct speech into reported speech, tense generally shifts back one step (present to past, past to past perfect).\n- Pronouns are adjusted to match the perspective of the reporter.\n- Time expressions like 'today,' 'tomorrow,' and 'yesterday' often change (e.g., 'today' becomes 'that day').\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: She said, \"I will meet you tomorrow.\"\n- Reported: She said she would meet me the next day.\n\n**Steps to convert direct to reported speech:**\n1. Identify the introductory verb (say, tell, mention).\n2. Change the tense of the verbs appropriately.\n3. Adjust pronouns and possessives.\n4. Modify time and place references if needed.\n\n**Practice converting statements:**\n- Direct: \"We are going to the park,\" John said.\n- Reported: John said they were going to the park.\n\nUsing reported speech correctly makes your communication more natural and fluent, especially when recounting conversations or news in American English.",
