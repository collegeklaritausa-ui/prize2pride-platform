  "content": "Welcome to the realm of American English sentence structure! Mastering how sentences are built is crucial for clear and effective communication. Sentences are composed of parts that work together to convey meaning. An essential understanding is the difference between simple, compound, and complex sentences:\n\n- **Simple Sentence:** Contains one independent clause. Example: *The dog barked.*\n- **Compound Sentence:** Contains two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction or semicolon. Example: *The sun set, and the stars appeared.*\n- **Complex Sentence:** Contains an independent clause and at least one dependent clause. Example: *Although it was raining, we went for a walk.*\n\nRemember, a complete sentence in American English must have at least a subject and a predicate and express a complete thought. Avoid sentence fragments and run-ons by ensuring proper punctuation and conjunction use.\n\nPractice these structures by combining ideas correctly, using commas, semicolons, and conjunctions to enhance your writing. Developing strong sentence skills transforms your ability to communicate with clarity and confidence in American English.",
