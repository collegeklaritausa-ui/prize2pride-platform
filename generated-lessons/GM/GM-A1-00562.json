  "content": "Welcome to your lesson on American English sentence structure! At the beginner level, understanding how to build simple sentences is crucial. Every complete sentence in American English typically follows the Subject + Verb + Object pattern.\n\nFor example:\n- Subject: The cat\n- Verb: eats\n- Object: fish\n\nComplete sentence: The cat eats fish.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- **Subject**: Who or what is the sentence about? (e.g., The cat)\n- **Verb**: What is the subject doing? (e.g., eats)\n- **Object**: Who or what is affected by the action? (e.g., fish)\n\nRemember, a complete sentence must have at least a subject and a verb. For example:\n- Correct: She runs.\n- Incorrect: Runs fast. (missing subject)\n\nPractice constructing sentences by choosing a subject, then adding a verb, and optionally an object. This structure helps make your communication clear and effective.\n\nAlso, watch out for sentence fragments! They are common mistakes for beginners. A fragment might look like a complete sentence but is missing key parts.\n\nWith practice, you'll be able to form clear, correct sentences that are the foundation of confident American English communication.",
