  "content": "Conditionals are a fundamental part of American English, allowing speakers to express real, possible, or imaginary situations and their consequences. There are three main types:\n\n1. First Conditional (Real): Used for real and possible situations in the future.\n- Structure: If + present simple, + will + base verb\n- Example: If it snows tonight, I will build a snowman.\n\n2. Second Conditional (Unreal in the Present/Future): Used for hypothetical or unlikely situations.\n- Structure: If + past simple, + would + base verb\n- Example: If I knew the answer, I would tell you.\n\n3. Third Conditional (Unreal in the Past): Used to talk about past situations that did not happen.\n- Structure: If + past perfect, + would have + past participle\n- Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the test.\n\nPracticing these conditionals helps you sound more natural and confident. Remember, the choice depends on whether the situation is real, likely, or hypothetical. Use the correct structure to clearly convey your message.\n\nExample dialogue:\nA: What would you do if you won the lottery?\nB: I would travel around the world.\n\nTip: Pay attention to verb forms and the context to determine the correct conditional to use.",
