  "content": "Conjunctions are words that connect parts of a sentence, making your ideas flow smoothly. In American English, the most common conjunctions are coordinating conjunctions, which include *and, but, or, nor, for, yet,* and *so*. These words link words, phrases, or independent clauses.\n\nFor example:\n- I like apples *and* oranges.\n- She was tired, *but* she finished her homework.\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly helps make your sentences clearer and more interesting. Remember, when connecting two complete sentences (independent clauses), use a coordinating conjunction with a comma before it.\n\nExample:\n- It was raining, *so* we stayed inside.\n\nPractice using conjunctions to join ideas and make your sentences more dynamic!",
