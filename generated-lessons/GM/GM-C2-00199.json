  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are essential tools that convey attitudes, intentions, and degrees of certainty. They help speakers express ability (can, could), possibility (may, might), necessity (must, have to), permission (may, can), and obligation (should, must). For example:\n\n- **Ability:** \"I can solve this problem.\"\n- **Possibility:** \"She might join us later.\"\n- **Necessity:** \"You must wear a seatbelt.\"\n- **Permission:** \"May I leave the table?\"\n\nModal verbs are followed by the base form of the main verb, without 'to':\n\n- Correct: \"She should study more.\"\n- Incorrect: \"She should to study more.\"\n\nNote that some modal verbs, like 'must' and 'should,' express obligation or advice, while others like 'might' and 'could' suggest possibility or potential.\n\nUsing these modals appropriately enhances clarity and politeness in communication. For example, using 'may' or 'might' can soften requests or suggestions, making interactions more courteous.\n\nMastery of modal verbs also includes understanding their negative forms and questions. For instance:\n\n- Negative: \"He cannot attend the meeting.\"\n- Question: \"Can you help me?\"\n\nPractice using modal verbs in different contexts to develop a natural and fluent command of American English.\n",
