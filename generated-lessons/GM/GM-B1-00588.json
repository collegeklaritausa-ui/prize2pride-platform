  "content": "To become a GOD of American English, mastering sentence structure is essential. Sentences are the building blocks of communication, and understanding how to craft them effectively elevates your language skills.\n\n**Simple sentences** contain a single independent clause. They are straightforward and clear, ideal for emphasizing a point. Example: \"The dog barked.\"\n\n**Compound sentences** combine two or more independent clauses with coordinating conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) or punctuation. They show relationships between ideas. Example: \"She studied hard, and she aced the test.\"\n\n**Complex sentences** include one independent clause and at least one dependent clause, providing depth and detail. Use subordinating conjunctions (because, although, since, when) to connect clauses. Example: \"Because it was raining, we stayed inside.\"\n\nMastering these structures involves recognizing their components and practicing combining ideas to create varied and engaging sentences. For example, transforming a simple sentence into a complex one adds nuance: \"She was tired\" can become \"She was tired after running for an hour.\"\n\nPracticing these structures enhances clarity and style, making your communication more effective and polished.",
