  "content": "The passive voice is a key grammatical structure in American English that allows speakers and writers to emphasize the action or the recipient rather than the doer. Unlike active voice, where the subject performs the action, passive voice shifts focus and can provide variety and formality to your communication.\n\n**Formation of Passive Voice:**\n- Use the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' (am, is, are, was, were, will be, has been, have been) based on the tense.\n- Follow with the past participle of the main verb.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The chef prepared the meal.\n- Passive: The meal was prepared by the chef.\n\n**When to Use Passive Voice:**\n- When the agent is unknown or unimportant.\n- To emphasize the action or result.\n- In formal or scientific writing.\n\n**Converting Active to Passive:**\n- Identify the object of the active sentence.\n- Move it to the subject position.\n- Use the correct form of 'to be' and the past participle.\n\n**Example Conversion:**\n- Active: The teacher grades the exams.\n- Passive: The exams are graded by the teacher.\n\nRemember, overusing passive voice can make your writing seem dull or indirect. Balance it with active sentences to keep your communication lively and clear.",
