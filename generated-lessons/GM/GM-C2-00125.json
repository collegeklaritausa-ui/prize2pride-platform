Let's dive into each type:\n\n**Zero Conditional:** Used for general truths and scientific facts.\n- Structure: If + present simple, present simple\n- Example: If water reaches 100°C, it boils.\n\n**First Conditional:** Talks about real and possible future situations.\n- Structure: If + present simple, will + base verb\n- Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will stay indoors.\n\n**Second Conditional:** Describes unreal or unlikely present or future situations.\n- Structure: If + past simple, would + base verb\n- Example: If I won the lottery, I would buy a house.\n\n**Third Conditional:** Reflects on past situations that didn't happen.\n- Structure: If + past perfect, would have + past participle\n- Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the test.\n\n**Mixed Conditionals:** Combine different time references.\n- Example 1 (Past Unreal + Present Result): If I had taken that job, I would be living in New York.\n- Example 2 (Present Unreal + Past Result): If I were taller, I would have joined the basketball team.\n\nRemember, mastering these structures allows you to express complex ideas with clarity and confidence.

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, using conditionals accurately is crucial for expressing opinions, making polite requests, and discussing possibilities in both casual and formal contexts. Americans value clarity and directness, so mastering conditionals helps you communicate effectively in everyday conversations, business meetings, and creative writing. Incorporating idiomatic expressions with conditionals, such as 'If I were you...' or 'If push comes to shove...', can also enhance your fluency and cultural understanding.",
