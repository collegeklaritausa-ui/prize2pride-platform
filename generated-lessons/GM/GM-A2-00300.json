  "content": "In American English, reported speech is used to share what someone else said. Instead of quoting the exact words, you tell the message in your own words. For example, if John says, 'I am hungry,' you can report it as, 'John said he was hungry.' Notice the changes:\n\n- Shifting the tense: 'am' becomes 'was' because it's in the past.\n- Changing pronouns: 'I' becomes 'he'.\n\n**Steps to convert direct speech into reported speech:**\n1. Identify the tense of the original sentence.\n2. Shift the tense back one step (present to past, past to past perfect, etc.).\n3. Change pronouns to match the new subject.\n4. Remove quotation marks.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: She said, 'I will go to the store.'\n- Reported: She said she would go to the store.\n\n- Direct: They said, 'We are playing soccer.'\n- Reported: They said they were playing soccer.\n\n**Note:** Some words like 'today,' 'tomorrow,' and 'here' may change when converting to reported speech:\n- 'Today' → 'that day'\n- 'Tomorrow' → 'the next day' or 'the following day'\n- 'Here' → 'there'\n\nPractice makes perfect! Remember, the goal is to convey what was said, not to quote directly.",
