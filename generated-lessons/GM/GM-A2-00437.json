  "content": "Welcome to your journey of becoming a GOD of American English! Today, we focus on prepositions—small words with big power. Prepositions link nouns or pronouns to other words in a sentence, helping us describe where things are or where they are going. For example, in the sentence 'The cat is under the table,' the preposition 'under' tells us the position of the cat relative to the table.\n\nCommon prepositions include: in, on, at, under, over, above, below, near, between, behind, in front of, to, from, with.\n\nHere are some examples:\n- Location: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n- Direction: \"She is going to the store.\"\n- Time (sometimes considered a preposition): \"We will meet at 3 PM.\"\n\nRemember, prepositions are essential for making your sentences clear and precise. Practice using them to describe places, directions, and times. Now, let's put your new knowledge into action!",
