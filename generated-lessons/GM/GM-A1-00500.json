  "content": "Welcome to the world of conjunctions, the essential connectors that make your sentences clear and dynamic! Conjunctions are words that link different parts of a sentence, allowing you to express ideas smoothly and logically.\n\nThere are two main types of conjunctions:\n\n1. Coordinating Conjunctions: These join words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance. The main coordinating conjunctions are **and**, **but**, **or**, **nor**, **for**, **yet**, and **so**.\n\n   - Example: I want to watch a movie **and** I want to read a book.\n   - Example: She is tired, **but** she keeps working.\n\n2. Subordinating Conjunctions: These connect a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing a relationship like cause, contrast, or time. Examples include **because**, **although**, **since**, **if**, **when**, and **while**.\n\n   - Example: I stayed inside **because** it was raining.\n   - Example: **Although** he was late, he still managed to catch the bus.\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly helps create sentences that are richer and more professional. Practice makes perfect!\n\nReady to become a master? Let’s move on to some exercises!",

  "culturalNotes": "In American English, conjunctions are vital in everyday conversations, professional writing, and storytelling. Americans value clarity and connection in communication, so mastering conjunctions will help you express ideas more effectively. For example, using 'and' to list multiple activities or 'because' to explain reasons are common in American speech and writing, reflecting the culture's emphasis on openness and reasoning.",
