  "content": "Prepositions are small but mighty words that establish relationships between different parts of a sentence. They often indicate location (in, on, at), time (before, after, during), or movement (toward, into, across). Mastery of prepositions allows you to specify the details of your message with clarity and precision.\n\n**Understanding Prepositions:**\nPrepositions connect a noun or pronoun (the object) to other words, creating prepositional phrases that add context. For example, in \"The dog is under the table,\" \"under\" links the dog to the table, explaining the dog's position.\n\n**Common Categories of Prepositions:**\n- *Place:* in, on, at, beside, between, under, over\n- *Time:* before, after, during, until, since\n- *Movement:* to, into, onto, out of, through, across\n\n**Using Prepositions Correctly:**\n- Remember that prepositions are usually followed by a noun or pronoun.\n- Avoid ending sentences with prepositions in formal writing, e.g., \"the book on which I rely\" instead of \"the book I rely on.\"\n- Be aware of prepositional idioms and fixed expressions (e.g., \"by the way,\" \"on behalf of\").\n\n**Examples:**\n- Place: \"The keys are on the counter.\"\n- Time: \"We will meet after lunch.\"\n- Movement: \"She ran toward the park.\"\n\nPracticing prepositions in context helps develop natural fluency and enhances your ability to describe situations accurately.",

Understanding these nuances helps learners sound more authentic and culturally aware in their language use.",
