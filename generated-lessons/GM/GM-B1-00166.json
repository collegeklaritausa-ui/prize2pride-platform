  "content": "Modal verbs are auxiliary (helping) verbs that add meaning to the main verb, expressing ability, possibility, necessity, obligation, or permission. In American English, modal verbs are used universally across formal and informal contexts, playing a crucial role in conveying intention and attitude.\n\nCommon modal verbs include: can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would, must, and ought to. Each modal has specific nuances:\n\n- 'Can' indicates ability or possibility. Example: \"I can swim.\"\n- 'Must' expresses necessity or a strong obligation. Example: \"You must finish your homework.\"\n- 'Might' suggests a possibility with less certainty. Example: \"They might come to the party.\"\n- 'Should' gives advice or recommends. Example: \"You should see a doctor.\"\n- 'Would' is used for hypothetical situations or polite requests. Example: \"Would you like some coffee?\"\n\nRemember, modal verbs do not take '-s' in the third person singular and are followed directly by the base form of the main verb. For example, \"He can go,\" not \"He cans go.\"\n\nModal verbs can also express different shades of meaning based on context and tone, which is vital in American English communication.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, modal verbs are often used in casual speech to convey politeness, suggestions, or uncertainty. For example, using 'might' or 'could' softens requests, making conversations more polite and less direct. Additionally, the emphasis on individual ability ('I can do it') reflects American values of independence and self-reliance. Understanding the appropriate use of modal verbs enhances not only grammatical accuracy but also cultural fluency in American English interactions.",
