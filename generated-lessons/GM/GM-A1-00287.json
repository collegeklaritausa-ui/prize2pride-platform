  "content": "Welcome to your journey to becoming a god of American English grammar! Today, we focus on reported speech, a powerful tool to relay conversations smoothly.\n\n**What is Reported Speech?**\nReported speech allows us to tell someone what another person said, without using their exact words. For example, if John says, \"I love pizza,\" you can report it as, \"John said he loved pizza.\"\n\n**Difference Between Direct and Reported Speech:**\n- *Direct Speech:* Quoting exact words, e.g., She said, \"I will call you.\"\n- *Reported Speech:* Paraphrasing the words, e.g., She said she would call me.\n\n**Tense Changes in Reported Speech:**\nWhen converting from direct to reported speech, tense often shifts back one step:\n- Present simple → Past simple\n- Present continuous → Past continuous\n- Present perfect → Past perfect\n- Past simple → Past perfect (rare)\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: \"I am tired,\" he said.\n- Reported: He said he was tired.\n\n**Steps to Convert:**\n1. Remove quotation marks.\n2. Change the tense of the verb as needed.\n3. Adjust time and place references:\n   - today → that day\n   - now → then\n   - here → there\n\n**Practice Example:**\n- Direct: \"We are going to the park,\" they said.\n- Reported: They said they were going to the park.\n\nBy mastering reported speech, you can confidently share conversations and express ideas more naturally in American English!",
