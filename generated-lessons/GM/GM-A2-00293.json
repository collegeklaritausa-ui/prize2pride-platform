  "content": "Welcome to your journey to becoming a GOD of American English! Today, we focus on reported speech, a powerful tool to share what others have said.\n\n**What is Reported Speech?**\nReported speech is when you tell someone what another person said, but you do not use the exact words. Instead, you paraphrase or summarize.\n\n**Direct Speech vs. Reported Speech**\n- Direct Speech: She said, \"I love ice cream!\"\n- Reported Speech: She said she loved ice cream.\n\n**How to Change Direct to Reported Speech:**\n1. Remove quotation marks.\n2. Change pronouns if needed (I, you, he, she, they).\n3. Adjust verb tense: present tense often shifts to past tense.\n4. Use reporting verbs like 'say,' 'tell,' or 'ask.'\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: John said, \"I am a student.\"\n- Reported: John said he was a student.\n\n- Direct: Mary asked, \"Are you coming?\"\n- Reported: Mary asked if I was coming.\n\n**Common Reporting Verbs:**\n- say\n- tell\n- ask\n- explain\n- mention\n\nRemember, mastering reported speech will make your American English sound more natural and confident!\n\nLet's practice transforming sentences together to become true GODS of American English!",
