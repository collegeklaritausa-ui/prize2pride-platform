  "content": "Welcome to the lesson on Reported Speech, a crucial aspect of American English that allows you to convey what others have said without quoting them directly. Understanding reported speech enhances your communication skills, making your conversations and writing more natural and fluent.\n\n**Direct vs. Indirect (Reported) Speech:**\n- Direct speech quotes the exact words spoken: She said, 'I'm coming.'\n- Indirect speech (reported speech) conveys the message without quoting directly: She said that she was coming.\n\n**Rules for Converting Direct to Reported Speech:**\n1. Change the tense of the verb:\n   - Present simple to past simple (e.g., 'I am hungry' → He said he was hungry)\n   2. Adjust pronouns and time expressions:\n   - 'I' becomes 'he/she,' and 'today' becomes 'that day'\n2. Use appropriate reporting verbs:\n   - 'say,' 'tell,' 'ask,' 'mention,' etc.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: He said, 'I will help you.'\n- Reported: He said that he would help me.\n\n**Common Reporting Verbs and Their Usage:**\n- Say/Says: General statements.\n- Tell/Tells: When indicating who is being addressed.\n- Ask/Asks: For questions.\n- Mention: For mentioning details.\n\n**Important Note:**\n- When reporting questions, change the question form into a statement and use 'if' or 'whether' for yes/no questions. For example:\n  - Direct question: 'Are you coming?'\n  - Reported: He asked if I was coming.\n\nBy mastering reported speech, you will be able to report conversations accurately, which is essential for both casual conversations and formal communication in American English.\n\n**Practice Tip:** Always pay attention to tense shifts and pronoun changes to ensure your reported speech is grammatically correct and natural sounding.",
