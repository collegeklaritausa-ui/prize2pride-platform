  "content": "Welcome to the realm of American English sentence structure, where mastery turns ordinary sentences into powerful tools of expression. Understanding the building blocks—clauses—is essential. An independent clause can stand alone as a sentence (e.g., 'The sun is shining'), while a dependent clause cannot (e.g., 'Although it was cold'). Combining these clauses using conjunctions like 'and,' 'but,' or 'because' allows for the creation of more nuanced sentences.\n\nSimple sentences contain just one independent clause. Example: 'She runs.'\n\nCompound sentences connect two independent clauses with coordinating conjunctions, often separated by a comma. Example: 'She runs, and he cycles.'\n\nComplex sentences incorporate one dependent and one independent clause. Use subordinating conjunctions like 'because,' 'since,' or 'although' to introduce dependent clauses. Example: 'Because she was tired, she went to bed early.'\n\nPay attention to punctuation rules: use commas before coordinating conjunctions in compound sentences, and after introductory dependent clauses. Proper punctuation clarifies meaning and improves readability.\n\nTo elevate your writing, practice combining sentences using various structures, balancing simplicity and complexity to suit your message. Remember, mastery over sentence structure is the foundation for conveying ideas clearly and convincingly.",
