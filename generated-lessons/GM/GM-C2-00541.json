  "content": "Mastering conjunctions is essential for crafting clear, elegant, and logically structured sentences in American English. Conjunctions serve as the glue that holds your ideas together, whether linking simple words or complex clauses.\n\n**Types of Conjunctions:**\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions:** These are the most common and connect words or independent clauses of equal importance. Remember the acronym FANBOYS:\n   - For\n   - And\n   - Nor\n   - But\n   - Or\n   - Yet\n   - So\n   \n   *Example:* \"She likes tea, but she doesn't like coffee.\"\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce subordinate clauses that depend on the main clause. They often indicate cause, time, condition, or contrast.\n   - Because, since, although, though, if, when, while, unless, after, before\n\n   *Example:* \"I'll call you when I arrive.\"\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions:** These come in pairs and work together to join equal sentence elements.\n   - Either...or, neither...nor, both...and, not only...but also, whether...or\n\n   *Example:* \"You can either stay here or come with us.\"\n\n**Practical Tips:**\n- Use coordinating conjunctions to link similar ideas.\n- Use subordinating conjunctions to add depth, cause-and-effect, or time relationships.\n- Use correlative conjunctions to emphasize choices or parallels.\n- Ensure that the clauses connected by conjunctions are grammatically complete (independent) unless a subordinating conjunction is used.\n\n**Advanced Usage:**\nCombine different conjunctions to create complex sentences, such as: \"Although she was tired, she finished her homework, and she went to bed early.\"\n\nBy mastering conjunctions, you will be able to craft sentences that are not only grammatically correct but also rich in meaning and flow seamlessly—truly becoming a GOD of American English.",
