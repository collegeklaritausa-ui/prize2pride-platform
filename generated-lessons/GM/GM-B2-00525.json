  "content": "Conjunctions are the connective tissue of the English language, seamlessly linking sentences and ideas to create coherence and fluency.\n\n**Types of Conjunctions:**\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions:** These connect two independent clauses or elements of equal importance. The most common are **for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so**. \n\n   - *Example:* I wanted to go for a walk, **but** it was raining.\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce subordinate clauses and show the relationship between the clause and the rest of the sentence. Common subordinators include **because, although, since, unless, while, if**.\n\n   - *Example:* She stayed home **because** she was feeling sick.\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions:** These come in pairs and work together to join equal grammatical units.\n\n   - *Examples:* **Either...or** (You can **either** stay **or** leave), **Neither...nor** (He likes **neither** coffee **nor** tea), **Both...and** (She is **both** intelligent **and** diligent).\n\n**Using Conjunctions Effectively:**\n- Ensure clarity by choosing the appropriate conjunction for the relationship you want to express.\n- Avoid comma splices by correctly separating independent clauses with coordinating conjunctions or semicolons.\n- Use subordinating conjunctions to indicate cause and effect, contrast, or condition.\n\n**Examples in Context:**\n- Coordinating: I was tired, **but** I finished my homework.\n- Subordinating: **Although** he was tired, he kept working.\n- Correlative: **Neither** of the options seems appealing, **nor** does it matter.\n\nMastering conjunctions allows you to craft more sophisticated, cohesive, and persuasive sentences—truly becoming a GOD of American English!\n",

  "culturalNotes": "In American English, the use of conjunctions is not only grammatical but also cultural—effective connectors are essential in persuasive speeches, polished essays, and everyday conversations. Americans value clarity and coherence, so mastering conjunctions is highly regarded in academic and professional settings. Additionally, understanding idiomatic expressions involving conjunctions, such as 'either...or' in everyday choices, reflects cultural nuances of decision-making and politeness.",
