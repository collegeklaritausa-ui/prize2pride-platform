  "content": "Welcome to your journey to becoming a GOD of American English! Today, we focus on prepositions, tiny words that make big differences in meaning. Prepositions connect nouns and pronouns to other words, giving us details about where, when, and how things happen.\n\n**Types of Prepositions:**\n- **Prepositions of Place:** in, on, under, between, beside\n- **Prepositions of Time:** at, during, before, after, on\n- **Prepositions of Direction:** to, toward, into, onto, through\n\n**Examples:**\n- Place: The keys are in the drawer.\n- Time: The meeting is at 2 PM.\n- Direction: They are going to the park.\n\n**Using Prepositions:**\n- Prepositions are always followed by a noun or pronoun called the object.\n- Prepositional phrases add details: \"On the table,\" \"Before noon.\"\n\nRemember, mastering prepositions helps your sentences become clearer and more natural in American English. Practice using different prepositions to describe where, when, and how actions happen!",
