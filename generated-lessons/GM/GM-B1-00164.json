  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that add meaning to the main verb, expressing ability, permission, necessity, advice, or possibility. Unlike other verbs, modal verbs do not change form according to the subject and are followed directly by the base form of the main verb.\n\nCommon modal verbs include: can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would.\n\nFor example:\n- Ability: \"I can speak three languages.\"\n- Permission: \"May I leave early today?\"\n- Necessity: \"You must wear a seatbelt.\"\n- Advice: \"You should see a doctor.\"\n- Possibility: \"It might snow tomorrow.\"\n\nIt's important to note that modal verbs can be combined with other modal verbs to express nuanced meanings, such as \"might have\" or \"should have,\" which refer to past possibilities or regrets.\n\nIn American English, modal verbs are essential for polite requests, giving advice, expressing obligation, and discussing possibilities. Mastering their correct usage allows you to communicate more effectively and confidently in diverse situations.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect—try constructing sentences with each modal to become a true GOD of American English!",
