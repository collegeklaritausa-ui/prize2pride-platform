  "content": "Welcome to the realm of the Passive Voice, a powerful tool in American English that shifts focus from the doer of an action to the receiver or the action itself. In active sentences, the subject performs the action: 'The teacher grades the papers.' In passive voice, the focus shifts to the object receiving the action: 'The papers are graded by the teacher.' The structure typically follows this pattern: \n\n**Passive Voice Formula:** \n\n**be** + past participle of the verb + (by + doer of the action)\n\nFor example:\n- Active: The chef cooks the meal.\n- Passive: The meal is cooked by the chef.\n\n**Key points:**\n- Not all sentences are suitable for passive voice.\n- Passive voice is often used in formal writing, reports, and when the doer is unknown or unimportant.\n- Be careful not to overuse passive voice, as it can make sentences less clear.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The kids play football.\n- Passive: Football is played by the kids.\n- Active: The company will release the new product.\n- Passive: The new product will be released by the company.\n\nPractice converting sentences from active to passive voice and vice versa to become fluent in this structure.",

Passive voice is often used in formal reports, scientific articles, and official documents to maintain objectivity and focus on actions rather than actors. Understanding when and how to use passive voice helps you sound more natural and professional in various contexts.",
