  "content": "Welcome to your journey to becoming a GOD of American English! Today, we'll explore modal verbs, which are small but mighty words that add meaning to your sentences.\n\n**What are Modal Verbs?**\nModal verbs are special words that help us express different ideas like ability, permission, or obligation. They are always used with the base form of the main verb.\n\n**Common Modal Verbs and Their Uses:**\n- **Can**: To express ability or permission. \n  *Example: I can swim. / Can I go outside?*\n- **Could**: Past ability, polite permission, or possibility.\n  *Example: I could run faster when I was younger.*\n- **May**: Permission or possibility.\n  *Example: May I use your phone? / It may rain today.*\n- **Might**: Possibility, less certain than may.\n  *Example: It might snow tomorrow.*\n- **Must**: Obligation or strong advice.\n  *Example: You must finish your homework.*\n- **Shall**: Formal suggestion or future intention.\n  *Example: Shall we go to the park?*\n- **Should**: Advice or recommendation.\n  *Example: You should eat more vegetables.*\n- **Will**: Future intention or promise.\n  *Example: I will call you later.*\n- **Would**: Polite requests, hypothetical situations.\n  *Example: Would you like some coffee?*\n\n**Using Modal Verbs in Sentences:**\n- Ability: *She can play the guitar.*\n- Permission: *May I leave early?*\n- Obligation: *You must wear a seatbelt.*\n- Possibility: *It might snow tonight.*\n\n**Tips:** Remember, modal verbs do not change form for different subjects.

Using 'please' and 'thank you' alongside modal verbs enhances politeness and shows respect, which is highly valued in American social interactions. For example, saying 'May I help you?' or 'Can I join you?' reflects good manners. Mastery of modal verbs will help you sound courteous and confident in various situations.",
