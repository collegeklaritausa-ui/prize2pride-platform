  "content": "Welcome to Lesson 8: Mastering Verb Tenses! Becoming a GOD of American English requires understanding how verbs change depending on when actions happen. Let's explore the three basic tenses:\n\n1. Present Tense: Use this to talk about habits, facts, or routines.\n   - Example: I eat breakfast every morning.\n\n2. Past Tense: Use this to describe actions that already happened.\n   - Example: Yesterday, I watched a movie.\n\n3. Future Tense: Use this for actions that will happen.\n   - Example: Tomorrow, I will go to the park.\n\n**Conjugation Tips:**\n- Regular verbs add -ed for past tense: walk → walked.\n- To form the future tense, use 'will' + base verb: will go, will eat.\n\n**Practice:**\n- Affirmative sentences in present: I work, She studies.\n- Past tense sentences: I worked, She studied.\n- Future tense sentences: I will work, She will study.\n\nRemember, mastering these tenses allows you to communicate clearly about past, present, and future actions — the foundation of fluent American English!",
