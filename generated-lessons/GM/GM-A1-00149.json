  "content": "Modal verbs are special auxiliary verbs that help us express ability, possibility, permission, obligation, and future intentions. In American English, modal verbs are simple and straightforward, making your speech clear and confident.\n\nCommon modal verbs include: can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, and would.\n\nFor example:\n- Ability: \"She can swim.\"\n- Permission: \"May I use your phone?\"\n- Obligation: \"You must wear a seatbelt.\"\n- Advice: \"You should see a doctor.\"\n- Future: \"I will visit my grandparents tomorrow.\"\n\nNote that modal verbs are followed by the base form of the main verb:\n- Correct: \"He can cook.\"\n- Incorrect: \"He can cooks.\"\n\nUsing modal verbs correctly helps you communicate more effectively and confidently in American English. Practice these forms in context to become a true master of modal verbs!",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, modal verbs often reflect the direct and straightforward communication style. For example, Americans frequently use 'must' and 'have to' to emphasize necessity, and 'can' to indicate ability or permission. Understanding these modal verbs helps you sound confident and polite in various social and professional situations. Additionally, the use of polite modal forms like 'may' and 'could' demonstrates respect and consideration, which are highly valued traits in American interactions.",
