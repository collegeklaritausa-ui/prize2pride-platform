  "content": "Welcome to the world of prepositions, the tiny words that pack a big punch in American English! Prepositions help us describe where things are, when events happen, and how actions are directed. For beginners, mastering prepositions is essential to making your sentences clear and natural.\n\nCommon prepositions include: in, on, at, to, into, from, with, about, over, under, and between. For example:\n- Location: The keys are in the drawer.\n- Time: The party starts at 7 PM.\n- Direction: She is going to the store.\n\nRemember, prepositions are always followed by a noun or pronoun, called the object of the preposition. For example, in the phrase 'on the table,' 'on' is the preposition and 'the table' is the object.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Try replacing prepositions in your sentences to see how meaning changes and to build confidence in your usage.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, prepositions are often used in casual conversations to describe spatial relationships and time. For example, when giving directions, Americans commonly say 'Go **down** the street' or 'Turn **into** the parking lot.' Understanding prepositions helps in navigating social interactions, such as asking for help or giving instructions, making your communication clearer and more natural.",
