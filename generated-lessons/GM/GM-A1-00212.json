  "content": "Welcome to your first step in mastering the passive voice! In American English, passive voice is used to emphasize the action or the recipient of the action rather than the doer. For example, instead of saying 'The chef cooked the meal,' you can say 'The meal was cooked by the chef.'\n\nPassive voice is formed with a form of the verb 'to be' plus the past participle of the main verb. The structure varies depending on the verb tense. Here are some examples:\n- Present Simple: The book is read by many students.\n- Past Simple: The letter was sent yesterday.\n- Future Simple: The package will be delivered tomorrow.\n\nNote that in casual American English, the phrase 'by + doer' is often omitted when the doer is unknown or unimportant, e.g., 'The window was broken.'\n\nUsing passive voice can make your writing more formal or focus on the action rather than the subject performing it. Practice converting active sentences into passive to become more comfortable with this structure.",
