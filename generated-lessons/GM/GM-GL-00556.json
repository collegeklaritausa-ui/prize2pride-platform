  "content": "Welcome to the realm of conjunctions—the ultimate architects of sentence harmony in American English. Conjunctions are the glue that holds ideas together, enabling you to craft sentences that flow smoothly and convey complex relationships.\n\n**1. Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS):** These are the backbone of compound sentences.\n- *Usage:* Connect two independent clauses.\n- *Example:* \"She studied hard, and she aced the test.\"\n- *Tip:* Remember FANBOYS to recall the main coordinating conjunctions.\n\n**2. Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce subordinate clauses, providing additional context.\n- *Usage:* Show cause, contrast, condition, or time.\n- *Example:* \"I'll call you when I arrive.\"\n- *Tip:* Use them to add depth and complexity.\n\n**3. Correlative Conjunctions:** These work in pairs to link balanced elements.\n- *Usage:* Emphasize alternatives or reinforce ideas.\n- *Example:* \"Either you apologize, or you face the consequences.\"\n\n**4. Advanced Uses:** Mastery involves blending conjunctions to create nuanced sentences.\n- *Example:* \"Not only did she win the award, but she also set a new record.\"\n\nAchieving mastery involves understanding subtle differences and selecting the perfect conjunction for every context. Your sentences will become more persuasive, elegant, and undeniably American in style.",
