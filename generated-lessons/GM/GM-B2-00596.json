  "content": "In American English, sentence structure plays a crucial role in effective communication. Understanding how to build and vary sentences allows speakers and writers to convey ideas clearly and engagingly. Let's explore the main types of sentences:\n\n1. **Simple Sentences**: These are the foundational building blocks, containing a single independent clause. Example: \"The dog barked loudly.\"\n\n2. **Compound Sentences**: These connect two independent clauses using coordinating conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) or a semicolon. Example: \"I wanted coffee, but the store was closed.\"\n\n3. **Complex Sentences**: These combine an independent clause with one or more dependent clauses, often introduced by subordinating conjunctions like because, although, since, or when. Example: \"She stayed home because she was feeling sick.\"\n\n4. **Proper punctuation** is essential to avoid run-on sentences and sentence fragments. For instance, a comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are joined only with a comma (e.g., \"It was late, I went to bed.\"). Correct methods include using a semicolon, coordinating conjunction, or splitting into two sentences.\n\n5. **Variety and clarity**: Using a mix of sentence types makes writing more engaging. Always ensure each sentence is complete and properly punctuated.\n\nBy mastering these structures, you will craft clear, varied, and compelling sentences that make your communication feel natural and confident.",
