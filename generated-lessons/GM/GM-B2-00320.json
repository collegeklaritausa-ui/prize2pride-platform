  "content": "Reported speech is a fundamental part of American English, allowing speakers to relay conversations, thoughts, or claims from others. It often involves transforming the original statement into a subordinate clause, adjusting pronouns, verb tenses, and time expressions accordingly.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Reporting Verbs:** Common verbs include 'say,' 'tell,' 'claim,' 'explain,' 'advise,' and 'suggest.' Choose the verb that best fits the context.\n\n2. **Structure:** \n- For direct speech: \"He said, 'I am tired.'\"\n- For reported speech: He said (that) he *was* tired.\n\n3. **Tense Shift Rules:** \n- Present simple → Past simple\n- Present continuous → Past continuous\n- Present perfect → Past perfect\n- Will → Would\nExamples:\n- Direct: \"I will call you.\"\n- Reported: She said she *would* call me.\n\n4. **Pronouns and Time Expressions:** Adjust pronouns to match the reporting person's perspective, and modify time references:\n- Today → That day\n- Tomorrow → The next day / The following day\n- Here → There\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: \"I am visiting my grandparents tomorrow.\"\n- Reported: He said he *was* visiting his grandparents the next day.\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n- Always check the tense after shifting.\n- Remember to include 'that' after reporting verbs, though it is optional in American English.\n- Be mindful of pronoun changes.\n\nIn American culture, reported speech is often used in journalism, storytelling, and casual conversations, making it an essential skill for clear and effective communication.",
