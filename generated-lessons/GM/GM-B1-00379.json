  "content": "In American English, articles are small words that precede nouns to clarify whether we are talking about something specific or general. There are two types: definite ('the') and indefinite ('a' and 'an').\n\nThe indefinite articles 'a' and 'an' are used when mentioning something for the first time or referring to any member of a group. Use 'a' before words that start with consonant sounds (e.g., a dog, a university) and 'an' before words that start with vowel sounds (e.g., an apple, an hour).\n\nThe definite article 'the' specifies a particular noun that both the speaker and listener are familiar with. For example, 'the car' refers to a specific car known to both parties.\n\n**Examples:**\n- I saw a bird in the sky. (any bird, not specific)\n- The bird I saw was a sparrow. (a specific bird previously mentioned)\n- She wants an umbrella. (any umbrella)\n- Could you hand me the pen? (a specific pen in sight or previously mentioned)\n\nRemember, the choice of 'a' or 'an' depends on the sound that begins the next word, not necessarily the spelling. For example, 'a university' (because it sounds like 'you-niversity').\n\nPractice paying attention to context and pronunciation to master the correct use of articles, transforming your American English into a polished, fluent style.",
