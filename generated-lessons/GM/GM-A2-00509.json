  "content": "Welcome to your lesson on conjunctions! Conjunctions are words that join parts of sentences, making your speech and writing smooth and easy to understand. Think of conjunctions as the 'glue' that holds your ideas together.\n\nIn American English, some common conjunctions are:\n- **And** (adds information): I like pizza and burgers.\n- **But** (shows contrast): I want to go outside, but it's raining.\n- **Or** (presents options): Do you want tea or coffee?\n\nUsing conjunctions helps you create longer, more interesting sentences. For example:\n- Simple sentences: I am tired. I want to rest.\n- Combined with conjunctions: I am tired **and** I want to rest.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Let’s try combining some sentences with conjunctions.\n\nRemember, the key to mastering conjunctions is to practice connecting your ideas smoothly and clearly.",
