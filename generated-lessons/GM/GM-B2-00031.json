  "content": "Welcome to the ultimate lesson on American English verb tenses! Mastery of verb tenses is essential for expressing time accurately and clearly. In this lesson, we will explore the four main tense aspects: simple, continuous (progressive), perfect, and perfect continuous, each with their unique functions and time frames.\n\n1. Present Tenses:\n- Simple Present: Describes habitual actions or general truths. \n  Example: 'I work from 9 to 5.'\n- Present Continuous: Describes ongoing actions happening now.\n  Example: 'I am working on my project.'\n- Present Perfect: Describes actions completed recently or with relevance to now.\n  Example: 'I have finished my report.'\n- Present Perfect Continuous: Emphasizes the duration of ongoing actions.\n  Example: 'I have been working here for five years.'\n\n2. Past Tenses:\n- Simple Past: Describes completed actions at a specific time in the past.\n  Example: 'I visited New York last year.'\n- Past Continuous: Describes actions in progress at a specific past moment.\n  Example: 'I was reading when you called.'\n- Past Perfect: Describes actions completed before another past action.\n  Example: 'I had already eaten when she arrived.'\n- Past Perfect Continuous: Emphasizes the duration of past ongoing actions before another past event.\n  Example: 'I had been studying for two hours before I took a break.'\n\n3. Future Tenses:\n- Simple Future: Describes actions that will happen.\n  Example: 'I will travel to California.'\n- Future Continuous: Describes ongoing future actions.\n  Example: 'I will be working at 10 a.m. tomorrow.'\n- Future Perfect: Describes actions that will be completed before a specific future time.\n  Example: 'By next week, I will have finished the project.'\n- Future Perfect Continuous: Emphasizes the duration of an ongoing future action.\n  Example: 'By next month, I will have been working here for a year.'\n\nRemember, context is key to choosing the correct tense. Pay attention to time indicators like 'yesterday,' 'now,' 'already,' 'by the time,' and others.\n\nPractice regularly by narrating your daily activities in different tenses to become a true GOD of American English!",
