  "content": "Welcome to your lesson on Reported Speech, a key skill for mastering American English! Reported speech is used when you want to share what someone else has said without quoting them directly. For example, if someone says, 'I like pizza,' you can report it as, 'He said he liked pizza.' \n\n**Direct vs. Indirect Speech:**\n- Direct speech uses quotation marks and exact words: \"I'm tired,\" she said.\n- Indirect speech (or reported speech) paraphrases the statement: She said she was tired.\n\n**Transforming Direct to Indirect Speech:**\n1. Change the tense of the verb back one step in time: present to past.\n2. Remove quotation marks.\n3. Use appropriate reporting verbs like 'say,' 'tell,' 'ask.'\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: \"Are you coming?\" he asked.\n- Indirect: He asked if I was coming.\n\n**Important Tips:**\n- When the reporting verb is in the past tense, the verb in the reported speech often shifts one tense back.\n- Questions and commands are also transformed accordingly.\n\n**Practice Examples:**\n- She said, \"I can help you.\"\n- He asked, \"Do you want coffee?\"\n\nBy mastering reported speech, you’ll improve your storytelling, conversations, and understanding of American English communication styles!",
