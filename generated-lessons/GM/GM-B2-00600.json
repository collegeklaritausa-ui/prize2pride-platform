  "content": "In American English, sentence structure is fundamental to effective communication. Understanding how to craft simple, compound, and complex sentences allows you to convey ideas clearly and persuasively.\n\n**Simple sentences** consist of a single independent clause: 'She runs every morning.' They are straightforward and easier to understand.\n\n**Compound sentences** join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so): 'She wanted to go to the park, but it was raining.' Notice the use of the coordinating conjunction to connect ideas.\n\n**Complex sentences** contain an independent clause and at least one dependent clause, often introduced by subordinating conjunctions (because, although, since): 'Although she was tired, she finished her homework.' This structure adds depth and detail.\n\n**Punctuation** plays a crucial role in sentence structure. Commas separate items in a list, set off introductory elements, and divide clauses. For example, in compound sentences, a comma before the conjunction is standard: 'I wanted to call you, but I was busy.'\n\nTo elevate your mastery, practice combining sentences using different structures and ensure proper punctuation. Recognizing the function of clauses and conjunctions will enable you to craft complex and nuanced sentences, making your writing more engaging and precise.",
