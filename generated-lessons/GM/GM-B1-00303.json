  "content": "Reported speech is a fundamental skill in American English, allowing you to relay what others have said without quoting their exact words. When converting direct speech into reported speech, pay attention to three key areas:\n\n1. **Tense Shift:** Usually, the tense in the verb changes back in time. For example, present tense becomes past tense.\n   - Direct: \"I am going to the store,\" she said.\n   - Reported: She said she was going to the store.\n\n2. **Pronoun Adjustment:** Change pronouns to match the perspective of the reporting speaker.\n   - Direct: \"I love this song,\" he said.\n   - Reported: He said he loved that song.\n\n3. **Time and Place Expressions:** Adjust words referring to time and place to fit the context.\n   - Direct: \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" she said.\n   - Reported: She said she would see me the next day.\n\n**Example transformations:**\n- Direct: \"We are planning a trip,\" they said.\n- Reported: They said they were planning a trip.\n\n**Reporting Verbs:** Usually, verbs like 'say' and 'tell' are used. Remember that 'tell' is followed by a person, while 'say' often isn't.\n\n**Special Note:** In American English, contractions are common in both direct and reported speech, making conversations sound natural and informal.\n\nPractice this at home by converting your favorite quotes or sentences into reported speech to build confidence and mastery.",
