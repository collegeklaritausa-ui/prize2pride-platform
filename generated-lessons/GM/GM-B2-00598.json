  "content": "In American English, mastering sentence structure is essential for clear and effective communication. Sentences are built from different types of clauses, which can be combined to form simple, compound, and complex sentences.\n\n**Simple sentences** consist of a single independent clause: *She sings.*\n\n**Compound sentences** join two independent clauses using coordinating conjunctions like *and, but, or, so, yet.* For example: *She sings, and he dances.*\n\n**Complex sentences** include an independent clause and one or more dependent clauses linked by subordinating conjunctions such as *because, although, since, if.* For example: *She sings because she loves music.*\n\nUnderstanding the structure and function of these sentence types allows you to express ideas more precisely and avoid run-on sentences or sentence fragments. Practice identifying these components in reading and writing, and experiment with combining clauses to form varied and engaging sentences.\n\nRemember, proper sentence structure enhances clarity, tone, and style—key elements in mastering American English.\n",
