  "content": "Welcome to the ultimate mastery of conditionals in American English! Conditionals are essential for expressing possibilities, hypotheses, and real or imaginary scenarios. We will explore four main types:\n\n1. Zero Conditional: Used for facts or universal truths.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, present simple\n   - Example: If you mix red and blue, you get purple.\n\n2. First Conditional: Used for real future possibilities.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, will + base verb\n   - Example: If it rains today, we will stay inside.\n\n3. Second Conditional: Used for unreal or hypothetical present or future situations.\n   - Structure: If + past simple, would + base verb\n   - Example: If I had a million dollars, I would travel the world.\n\n4. Third Conditional: Used for unreal past situations.\n   - Structure: If + past perfect, would have + past participle\n   - Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the test.\n\nUnderstanding these conditionals allows you to express a range of ideas from certainty to hypothetical scenarios. Practice their structure and usage through real-life examples and conversation.\n\nRemember, mastering conditionals empowers you to communicate more precisely and confidently in American English!",
