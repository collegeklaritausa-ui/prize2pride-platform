  "content": "Welcome to the world of American English grammar! Mastering verb tenses is essential for clear communication. In this lesson, we will focus on the three primary tenses: present, past, and future.\n\n1. Present Tense:\n- Used for routines and facts.\n- Example: She **reads** every night.\n- Forms:\n  - Simple Present: I/You/We/They **work**; He/She/It **works**.\n  - Present Continuous (for ongoing actions): I am **working** now.\n\n2. Past Tense:\n- Used for completed actions.\n- Example: I **watched** a movie yesterday.\n- Forms:\n  - Simple Past: I/You/We/They **played**; He/She/It **played**.\n  - Past Continuous (for ongoing past actions): I was **reading** when you called.\n\n3. Future Tense:\n- Used for actions that will happen.\n- Example: We **will go** to the park.\n- Forms:\n  - Simple Future: I/You/We/They **will** + base verb.\n  - Future Continuous (for ongoing future actions): I will be **traveling** next week.\n\nRemember, mastering these tenses allows you to express yourself clearly and confidently in American English. Practice forming sentences in each tense and pay attention to context clues to choose the correct form.",
