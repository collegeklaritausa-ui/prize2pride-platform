  "content": "Welcome to the world of conditionals in American English! Conditionals are sentences that talk about possibilities, real or imaginary situations, and their outcomes. There are four main types:\n\n1. Zero Conditional: Used for facts or general truths.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, present simple.\n   - Example: If you heat water, it boils.\n\n2. First Conditional: Used for real future possibilities.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, will + base verb.\n   - Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will stay inside.\n\n3. Second Conditional: Used for hypothetical present or future situations.\n   - Structure: If + past simple, would + base verb.\n   - Example: If I had a million dollars, I would buy a house.\n\n4. Third Conditional: Used for past hypothetical situations.\n   - Structure: If + past perfect, would have + past participle.\n   - Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the test.\n\nPractice simple sentences to become comfortable with each type. Remember, using the correct tense and structure is key to sounding like a native speaker!\n\nLet's practice with some common examples:\n- Zero: If you feel sick, you go to the doctor.\n- First: If you feel sick, you will see a doctor.\n- Second: If I were you, I would see a doctor.\n- Third: If I had gone to bed earlier, I wouldn't have been so tired yesterday.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, conditionals are often used in everyday conversations, especially when talking about plans, possibilities, and regrets. American English tends to favor contractions and a casual tone, so you'll often hear 'If I were you...' instead of the more formal 'If I was you...' in spoken language. Mastering conditionals will help you communicate more naturally and confidently in various social and professional contexts.",
