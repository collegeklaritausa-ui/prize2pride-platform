  "content": "Prepositions are essential components of English grammar that establish relationships between different parts of a sentence. Mastery of prepositions allows you to express location, time, direction, and other relationships precisely. For example, in the sentence 'The cat is *under* the bed,' the preposition 'under' shows the relationship of the cat's position relative to the bed.\n\nCommon prepositions of place include *in, on, at, under, over, between,* and *next to.* Prepositions of time include *before, after, during, until, at, on,* and *by.* Prepositions of direction often include *to, toward, into, out of, through,* and *across.*\n\nUsing prepositions correctly involves understanding their function within a sentence and choosing the appropriate preposition to convey your intended relationship. For instance, saying \"I will meet you *at* 5 pm\" specifies a particular time, while \"I will meet you *in* the park\" indicates a location.\n\nRemember, prepositions often form prepositional phrases, which provide additional context: \"He sat *on the sofa* during the movie.\" Here, 'on the sofa' is the prepositional phrase, giving more detail about where he sat.\n\nPractice and attention to detail are key to mastering prepositions, which will elevate your American English to a mastery level.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, prepositions are often used idiomatically, which can sometimes confuse learners. For example, Americans say 'on time' (meaning punctual) rather than 'in time,' despite the literal meaning. Additionally, prepositional phrases are prominent in everyday speech, from giving directions ('Turn left *at* the corner') to scheduling ('The meeting is *at* 3 PM'). Understanding these common usages enhances both comprehension and natural expression in American English.",
