  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, the use of modal verbs reflects politeness, formality, and clarity in communication. For example, 'May I?' is considered polite when requesting permission, embodying respect and courtesy. Americans value directness combined with politeness, and mastering modal verbs allows speakers to navigate social situations with finesse. Additionally, the informality of spoken American English often leans on contractions like 'can't,' 'won't,' and 'shouldn't,' which are essential for sounding natural and authentic. Understanding these cultural nuances enhances your ability to communicate effectively and confidently in diverse American contexts.",
