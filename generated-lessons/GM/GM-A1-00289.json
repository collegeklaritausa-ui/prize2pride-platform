  "content": "Welcome, future GODS of American English! Today, we dive into the powerful world of Reported Speech — a crucial skill for sounding natural and confident in conversations. When someone tells you something, you can report it to others without quoting them directly. Instead, you paraphrase, often changing words and tense.\n\n**Key concepts:**\n- **Tense Shift:** When converting direct speech into reported speech, the verb tense usually shifts back in time. For example, 'I am happy,' becomes 'he said he was happy.'\n- **Pronoun Adjustment:** Change pronouns to match the speaker's perspective. If someone says, 'I am tired,' and you report it, it becomes, 'He said he was tired.'\n- **Time and Place Expressions:** Words like 'today,' 'tomorrow,' or 'here' often change when reported. For example, 'I will see you tomorrow,' becomes 'He said he would see me the next day.'\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: She said, 'I love this song.'\n- Reported: She said she loved that song.\n\n- Direct: He said, 'I am going to the store.'\n- Reported: He said he was going to the store.\n\nPractice converting sentences to build mastery and become a true GOD of American English!\n",
