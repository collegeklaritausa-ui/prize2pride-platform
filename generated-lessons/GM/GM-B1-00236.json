  "content": "The passive voice is a vital aspect of American English, especially in formal writing, journalism, and situations where the focus is on the action or the recipient rather than the doer. To form the passive voice, use the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' plus the past participle of the main verb. For example, in the present tense, 'The chef cooks the meal' (active) becomes 'The meal is cooked by the chef' (passive). \n\n**When to Use the Passive Voice:**\n- When the doer is unknown or unimportant (e.g., 'The window was broken yesterday.')\n- To emphasize the action or the recipient of the action.\n- In formal or scientific writing (e.g., 'The experiment was conducted in 2020.')\n\n**Passive Voice Structure:**\n- Subject + be (conjugated) + past participle + (optional 'by' + agent)\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The students completed the project.\n- Passive: The project was completed by the students.\n\n**Note:** Be cautious not to overuse the passive voice, as it can sometimes make sentences less direct or harder to read. A good rule of thumb is to use it when it clarifies the sentence or fits the context appropriately.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, clarity and directness are highly valued in communication. Using the passive voice appropriately can lend a formal or professional tone to writing, such as in news reports, scientific articles, and official documents. However, overusing passive constructions may reduce clarity, so effective writers balance active and passive voice based on the context. Awareness of this nuance enhances your mastery of American English and helps you communicate with precision and cultural sensitivity.",
