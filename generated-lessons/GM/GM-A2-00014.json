  "content": "Welcome to the world of American English verb tenses! In this lesson, we'll explore how to talk about actions happening now, in the past, or in the future.\n\n**Present Tense:** Use the base form of the verb for habits, facts, or routines. Example: 'I work every day.' For he, she, it, add '-s' or '-es': 'He works on weekends.'\n\n**Past Tense:** Describe completed actions. Regular verbs add '-ed': 'I played soccer yesterday.' Irregular verbs change form: 'She went to the store.'\n\n**Future Tense:** Talk about what will happen using 'will' + base verb: 'They will travel next summer.'\n\n**Practice Tips:**\n- Regular verbs follow the same pattern. Example: 'talk → talked,' 'play → played.'\n- Irregular verbs have unique forms. Memorize common ones such as 'be → was/were,' 'have → had,' 'go → went.'\n\nMastering these tenses will allow you to confidently discuss your daily routines, past experiences, and future plans, making your American English sound natural and fluent!",
