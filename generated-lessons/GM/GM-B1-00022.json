  "content": "Welcome to Lesson #22: Verb Tenses in American English. Mastery of verb tenses is essential for expressing time accurately and adding nuance to your communication.\n\n**1. Present Tense**:\n- Simple Present: Describes habitual actions or facts. \n  Example: I walk to work.\n- Present Progressive: Describes actions happening now. \n  Example: I am walking.\n- Present Perfect: Describes actions completed recently or with relevance to the present. \n  Example: I have walked today.\n- Present Perfect Progressive: Shows ongoing actions that started in the past and continue now. \n  Example: I have been walking for an hour.\n\n**2. Past Tense**:\n- Simple Past: Actions completed in the past. \n  Example: I walked yesterday.\n- Past Progressive: Actions ongoing in the past. \n  Example: I was walking when you called.\n- Past Perfect: Actions completed before another past action. \n  Example: I had walked before the meeting.\n- Past Perfect Progressive: Continuous actions that were happening up to a specific past point. \n  Example: I had been walking for an hour when it started to rain.\n\n**3. Future Tense**:\n- Simple Future: Actions that will happen. \n  Example: I will walk tomorrow.\n- Future Progressive: Actions ongoing at a future time. \n  Example: I will be walking at 5 PM.\n- Future Perfect: Actions completed before a future time. \n  Example: I will have walked 10 miles by then.\n- Future Perfect Progressive: Ongoing actions that will be happening up to a future point. \n  Example: I will have been walking for two hours by then.\n\nMastering these tenses will allow you to express yourself clearly about past, present, and future events, making your American English sound natural and confident.\n\nRemember: Context determines the right tense to use. Practice by narrating your day, describing past experiences, or planning future activities to internalize these concepts.",
