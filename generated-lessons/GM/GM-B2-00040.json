In this lesson, we will explore the intricacies of verb tenses, essential for expressing time frames and aspects accurately.\n\n**1. Simple Tenses:**\n- Present Simple: Express habitual actions or facts. *Example: I work every day.*\n- Past Simple: Describe completed actions in the past. *Example: She visited New York last year.*\n- Future Simple: Indicate actions that will happen. *Example: They will arrive tomorrow.*\n\n**2. Continuous (Progressive) Tenses:**\n- Present Continuous: Actions happening now. *Example: I am reading.*\n- Past Continuous: Actions ongoing in the past. *Example: He was studying when you called.*\n- Future Continuous: Actions that will be ongoing in the future. *Example: I will be traveling next week.*\n\n**3. Perfect Tenses:**\n- Present Perfect: Actions completed at an unspecified time before now. *Example: She has visited Paris.*\n- Past Perfect: Actions completed before another past action. *Example: They had left before I arrived.*\n- Future Perfect: Actions that will be completed before a future point. *Example: By next year, I will have graduated.*\n\n**4. Perfect Continuous Tenses:**\n- Present Perfect Continuous: Actions that started in the past and continue. *Example: I have been working here for five years.*\n- Past Perfect Continuous: Duration of past actions before another past action. *Example: They had been waiting for hours.*\n- Future Perfect Continuous: Duration of future actions up to a point. *Example: By then, I will have been living here for a decade.*\n\n**Example Sentences:**\n- Correct: \"She has been studying all night.\"\n- Incorrect: \"She has studying all night.\"\n\nUnderstanding and mastering these tenses will allow you to convey your thoughts more clearly and confidently in American English.
