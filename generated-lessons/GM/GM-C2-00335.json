  "content": "Welcome to the ultimate lesson on Reported Speech, your gateway to speaking and writing with mastery in American English. Reported speech allows you to share what someone else has said, and mastering it is crucial for effective communication.\n\n**Basic Rules:**\n- When transforming direct speech to reported speech, tense usually shifts back in time.\n- Use appropriate reporting verbs like 'say,' 'tell,' 'ask,' etc.\n- Adjust pronouns, possessives, and time references as needed.\n\n**Tense Changes in Reported Speech:**\n| Direct Speech | Reported Speech |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Present simple: \"I eat.\" | Past simple: She said she *ate*. |\n| Present continuous: \"I am eating.\" | Past continuous: He said he *was eating*. |\n| Past simple: \"I went.\" | Past perfect: She said she *had gone*. |\n| Will future: \"I will go.\" | Would: He said he *would go*. |\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: \"Do you like pizza?\" → Reported: She asked if I *liked* pizza.\n- Direct: \"Please send the report.\" → Reported: He asked me to *send* the report.\n- Direct: \"Where are you from?\" → Reported: She inquired where I *was from*.\n\n**Using Reporting Verbs:**\n- 'Say' and 'tell' are common but differ in structure:\n  - 'Say' is usually followed by what was said.\n  - 'Tell' is followed by the person being addressed.\n- For questions, use 'ask' or 'wonder.'\n- For commands or requests, use 'ask' or 'tell' with an object.\n\n**Special Cases:**\n- If the original statement is a question, the word order changes accordingly.\n- When the statement contains modal verbs, they often change (e.g., 'can' to 'could', 'will' to 'would').\n\nPracticing these rules will elevate your ability to report speech accurately, making you a true GOD of American English communication.\n\nRemember: Always consider the context to choose the correct tense and reporting verb for natural and clear communication.",
