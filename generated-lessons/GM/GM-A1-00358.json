  "content": "Articles are small words that accompany nouns to give us more information about whether we're talking about something specific or something in general. In American English, the two types of articles are the definite article 'the' and the indefinite articles 'a' and 'an.'\n\n**Indefinite Articles ('a' and 'an')**:\n- Use 'a' before words that begin with a consonant sound: 'a cat,' 'a university.'\n- Use 'an' before words that begin with a vowel sound: 'an apple,' 'an hour.'\n\n**Definite Article ('the')**:\n- Use 'the' when referring to something specific or something already mentioned: 'the sun,' 'the book I read yesterday.'\n- Use 'the' with unique objects or well-known entities: 'the Earth,' 'the President.'\n\n**Examples**:\n- I saw **a** movie last night.\n- **The** movie was exciting.\n- She wants to buy **an** umbrella.\n- **The** umbrella in the closet is broken.\n\nRemember, the choice of 'a' or 'an' depends on the sound that starts the next word, not necessarily the letter. For example, 'an hour' (because 'hour' starts with a vowel sound), but 'a university' (because 'university' starts with a consonant sound).\n\nBy mastering articles, you'll be able to communicate more clearly and naturally in American English!",
