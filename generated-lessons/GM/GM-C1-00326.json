  "content": "Achieving mastery in reported speech requires a deep understanding of how to convey someone else's words accurately while maintaining the appropriate tone and context. In American English, reported speech often involves tense backshift, pronoun adjustments, and the selection of suitable reporting verbs. For example, when transforming direct speech into reported speech:\n\n- Tense backshift: Present simple becomes past simple, present continuous becomes past continuous, etc.\n- Pronouns change based on the perspective: 'I' becomes 'he/she/they.'\n- Time expressions may also shift: 'today' becomes 'that day,' 'tomorrow' becomes 'the next day.'\n\n**Examples:**\n\n1. Direct: \"I will see you tomorrow,\" she said.\n   Reported: She said she *would* see me *the next day*.\n\n2. Direct: \"We are planning a trip,\" they told me.\n   Reported: They told me they *were* planning a trip.\n\n3. Using different reporting verbs can alter the nuance:\n   - She *claimed* she was innocent.\n   - She *admitted* she made a mistake.\n   - He *suggested* we leave early.\n\n**Advanced points:**\n- When reporting questions, invert the word order or use 'if'/'whether' for yes/no questions.\n- For commands and requests, use 'tell,' 'ask,' or 'order' plus an infinitive.\n- Be mindful of the tone, especially in indirect speech, which can soften or intensify the original message.\n\nIn American English, informal reported speech often employs idiomatic expressions and relaxed structures, especially in spoken contexts, making it essential for students to familiarize themselves with both formal and colloquial variations.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, direct and indirect speech are widely used in everyday conversations, media, and business communication. Americans value clarity and directness, so mastering reported speech can enhance both formal and informal interactions. Understanding the contextual tone—whether polite, assertive, or casual—is essential, especially in a multicultural society where language nuances impact social dynamics. Additionally, idiomatic expressions often appear in reported speech, reflecting American humor, idioms, or regionalisms, which add flavor and authenticity to communication.",
