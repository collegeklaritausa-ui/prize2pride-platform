  "content": "Welcome to the world of modal verbs—powerful tools that help you express ability, possibility, permission, and obligation in American English. As a beginner, mastering modal verbs is essential for clear and effective communication.\n\n**What are Modal Verbs?**\nModal verbs are auxiliary verbs that accompany main verbs to add meaning. Examples include can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, and would.\n\n**Examples and Usage:**\n- **Can**: Express ability or possibility. e.g., I can ride a bike.\n- **May**: Ask for permission or express possibility. e.g., May I use your phone?\n- **Must**: Show obligation or strong suggestion. e.g., You must wear a seatbelt.\n- **Should**: Give advice or recommendation. e.g., You should study for the test.\n- **Will**: Indicate future intention or promise. e.g., I will call you tomorrow.\n\n**Simple Sentences Using Modal Verbs:**\n- She **can** sing.\n- **May** I go outside?\n- You **must** eat your vegetables.\n- We **will** meet at 5 p.m.\n- He **should** apologize.\n\nRemember, modal verbs do not change form for different subjects. For example, you say 'He can swim,' not 'He cans swim.'\n\n**Tips for Using Modal Verbs:**\n- Use 'can' for ability.\n- Use 'may' for permission.\n- Use 'must' for obligation.\n- Use 'should' for advice.\n- Use 'will' for future actions.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Keep practicing these modal verbs, and you'll become a true GOD of American English in no time!",
