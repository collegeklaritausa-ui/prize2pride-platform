  "content": "Welcome to the realm of Passive Voice mastery! In American English, the passive voice is a powerful tool to emphasize the action or the recipient of the action rather than the doer. It is especially prevalent in formal writing, news reports, and scientific contexts.\n\n**Understanding Passive Voice:**\n- An active sentence: 'The chef cooked the meal.'\n- Corresponding passive sentence: 'The meal was cooked by the chef.'\n\n**Construction:**\n- To form the passive voice, use the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' + the past participle of the main verb.\n- Example: 'The report is prepared by the team.'\n\n**When to Use Passive Voice:**\n- When the doer is unknown or irrelevant: 'The window was broken.'\n- To emphasize the action or the object: 'The novel was written in 1920.'\n- To create a formal tone suitable for official documents.\n\n**Transforming Sentences:**\n- Active: 'The teacher grades the tests.'\n- Passive: 'The tests are graded by the teacher.'\n\nRemember, while passive constructions can be useful, overusing them can make writing dull or indirect. Use the active voice when clarity and directness are needed.\n\nPractice makes perfect—next, we'll test your skills with some exercises!",
