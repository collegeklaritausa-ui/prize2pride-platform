  "content": "Welcome to Lesson 4: Verb Tenses! Today, we will become GODS of American English by mastering the fundamental verb tenses.\n\nFirst, let's look at the **Simple Present** tense. This tense tells us about routines and facts. For example, 'I eat breakfast every morning.' Notice how we add an 's' for he, she, or it: 'He **runs** fast.'\n\nNext, the **Simple Past** tense is used for actions completed in the past. Regular verbs typically add '-ed': 'They **walked** to the park.' Irregular verbs change form: 'She **went** to the store.'\n\nFinally, the **Future Tense** shows what will happen. Use 'will' + base verb: 'I **will call** you later.' Or, use 'going to' for plans: 'We **are going to visit** grandma this weekend.'\n\nRemember, mastering these tenses will help you communicate clearly about past, present, and future actions in American English.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Keep practicing these forms with real-life examples to become a true GOD of American English verb tenses.",

For example, 'I'm going to see a movie tonight' is a typical way Americans talk about their plans. Using correct verb tenses helps you sound confident and clear, which is highly valued in American social and professional settings.",
