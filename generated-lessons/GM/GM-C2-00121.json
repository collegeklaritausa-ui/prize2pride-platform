Let's break down the four main types:\n\n1. Zero Conditional:\n- Use: Facts and general truths.\n- Structure: If + Present Simple, Present Simple.\n- Example: If you heat ice, it melts.\n\n2. First Conditional:\n- Use: Real and possible future situations.\n- Structure: If + Present Simple, will + Base Verb.\n- Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will stay indoors.\n\n3. Second Conditional:\n- Use: Unlikely or hypothetical present or future situations.\n- Structure: If + Past Simple, would + Base Verb.\n- Example: If I won the lottery, I would travel the world.\n\n4. Third Conditional:\n- Use: Regret or imagining a different past.\n- Structure: If + Past Perfect, would have + Past Participle.\n- Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.\n\nMastering these structures allows you to speak and write with precision, conveying different levels of reality and imagination.
