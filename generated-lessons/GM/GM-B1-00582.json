  "content": "In American English, sentence structure is foundational to clear and effective communication. A sentence typically consists of a subject and a predicate, forming a complete thought. There are four main types of sentences:\n\n1. Declarative sentences state facts or opinions. Example: \"The sky is blue.\"\n2. Interrogative sentences ask questions. Example: \"Are you coming to the party?\"\n3. Imperative sentences give commands or requests. Example: \"Please close the door.\"\n4. Exclamatory sentences express strong emotion. Example: \"What a beautiful sunset!\"\n\nUnderstanding sentence components is crucial. An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence, while a dependent clause cannot. For example:\n- Independent: \"She runs every morning.\"\n- Dependent: \"Because she wants to stay healthy.\"\n\nCombining clauses using conjunctions (and, but, or, so, because) allows you to form compound and complex sentences. For example:\n- Compound: \"I wanted to go for a walk, but it started raining.\"\n- Complex: \"Although it was cold, we went swimming.\"\n\nAvoid common errors such as run-on sentences and comma splices by ensuring proper punctuation and conjunction use.\n\nMastering these structures will enable you to write more sophisticated sentences and communicate more effectively in American English.",
