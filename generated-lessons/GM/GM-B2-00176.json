  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are essential tools that convey a range of meanings including ability, permission, obligation, advice, and possibility. They are always followed by the base form of the main verb without 'to'.\n\n**Common Modal Verbs and Their Functions:**\n\n- **Can / Could:** Express ability or possibility.\n  - *I can swim.*\n  - *Could you help me?*\n\n- **May / Might:** Indicate permission or possibility.\n  - *May I use your phone?*\n  - *It might snow tonight.*\n\n- **Shall / Should:** Offer suggestions, or express obligation.\n  - *Shall we go?*\n  - *You should see a doctor.*\n\n- **Will / Would:** Future intentions, polite requests, or hypothetical situations.\n  - *I will call you tomorrow.*\n  - *Would you like some coffee?*\n\n- **Must / Have to:** Express obligation or necessity.\n  - *You must wear a seatbelt.*\n  - *I have to finish this report.*\n\nRemember, modal verbs do not change according to the subject (I, you, he, she, it, we, they). Also, they do not have past forms in the same way regular verbs do, but some modals like 'could', 'might', and 'would' serve as past tense equivalents.\n\n**Modal Questions & Negatives:**\n\n- To form negatives, add 'not' after the modal verb: *I cannot (can't) attend.*\n- To ask questions, invert the subject and modal: *Can you help me?*",
