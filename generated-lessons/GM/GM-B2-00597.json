  "content": "In American English, mastering sentence structure is essential for clear and effective communication. Sentences are built from various components, including subjects, predicates, objects, and modifiers. There are three main types of sentences:\n\n1. Simple Sentences: Contain one independent clause. Example: \"She runs every morning.\"\n2. Compound Sentences: Consist of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction or semicolon. Example: \"I wanted to watch a movie, but I was too tired.\"\n3. Complex Sentences: Have an independent clause and at least one dependent clause. Example: \"Although it was raining, we went hiking.\"\n\nUnderstanding how to combine these structures allows you to create more nuanced and expressive sentences. Pay attention to syntax rules, such as proper word order (Subject + Verb + Object), and the correct use of punctuation to connect ideas.\n\nExample of combining structures:\n- Simple: \"He studies.\" \n- Compound: \"He studies hard, and he gets good grades.\"\n- Complex: \"Because he studies hard, he excels in school.\"\n\nAdvanced mastery involves varying sentence length and complexity to maintain reader interest and convey precise meaning. Remember, the goal is clarity and style—your sentences should serve your communication purpose effectively.",
