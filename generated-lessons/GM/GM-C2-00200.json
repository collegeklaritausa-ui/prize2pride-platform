  "content": "Welcome to the ultimate lesson in Modal Verbs—your gateway to becoming a true GOD of American English! Modal verbs are essential tools that add nuance, mood, and precision to your speech and writing. They help you express ability ('can'), permission ('may'), obligation ('must'), advice ('should'), and possibility ('might').\n\nUnderstanding their correct usage can elevate your mastery from basic to legendary. For example:\n- Ability: \"I can finish the project today.\"\n- Permission: \"May I borrow your car?\"\n- Obligation: \"You must wear a seatbelt.\"\n- Advice: \"You should see a doctor.\"\n- Possibility: \"It might snow tomorrow.\"\n\nNote that some modal verbs are interchangeable depending on context, but subtle differences change meaning. For example, 'must' versus 'have to' often both indicate obligation, but 'must' can express a strong personal obligation or deduction, whereas 'have to' tends to reflect external requirements.\n\nMastering modal verbs involves understanding their form (they do not change for tense, but their main verbs do), their placement in sentences, and their contextual appropriateness. Practice using them in different combinations to convey complex ideas.\n\nRemember, mastery of modal verbs allows you to communicate with clarity and confidence in any situation—formal or informal—making you a true GOD of American English!",
