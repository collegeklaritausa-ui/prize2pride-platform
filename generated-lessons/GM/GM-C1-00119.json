  "content": "In advanced American English, conditionals are not just about basic if-then statements; they are tools for nuanced expression of reality, possibility, and hypothetical situations. Understanding the full spectrum—from zero to mixed conditionals—enables mastery in sophisticated communication.\n\nZero conditional (general truths):\n- Structure: If + present simple, present simple\n- Example: If you heat ice, it melts.\n\nFirst conditional (real future possibility):\n- Structure: If + present simple, will + base verb\n- Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will cancel the picnic.\n\nSecond conditional (hypothetical present or future):\n- Structure: If + past simple, would + base verb\n- Example: If I were rich, I would travel the world.\n\nThird conditional (hypothetical past):\n- Structure: If + past perfect, would have + past participle\n- Example: If she had studied harder, she would have passed the test.\n\nMixed conditionals (combining time frames):\n- Example 1: If I had studied law, I would be a lawyer now.\n- Example 2: If he were more experienced, he would have been hired earlier.\n\nAdvanced students should focus on the subtle differences and appropriate contexts for each type, especially in complex sentences and when expressing nuanced meaning. Pay attention to modal verbs and verb tense consistency to avoid common errors such as mismatched tenses or overgeneralization.",
