  "content": "Modal verbs are essential tools in American English that help us convey different shades of meaning related to ability, permission, obligation, advice, and possibility. Unlike regular verbs, modal verbs do not change form according to the subject or tense (with some exceptions). They are always followed by the base form of the main verb.\n\nCommon modal verbs include:\n- Can / Could: Express ability or possibility.\n- May / Might: Indicate permission or chance.\n- Must / Have to: Show obligation or necessity.\n- Should / Ought to: Offer advice or recommendations.\n- Will / Would: Express future intentions or hypothetical situations.\n\nExamples:\n- Ability: \"I can swim.\"\n- Permission: \"May I leave early today?\"\n- Obligation: \"You must wear a seatbelt.\"\n- Advice: \"You should see a doctor.\"\n- Future: \"I will call you tomorrow.\"\n\nRemember, modal verbs are versatile and can change the tone of your message. Use 'must' for strong necessity, 'should' for advice, and 'might' or 'may' for uncertainty or possibility. Practice these in sentences to become a true GOD of American English modal mastery!",
