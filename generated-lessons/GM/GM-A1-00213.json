  "content": "Welcome to the world of the passive voice! In American English, sentences can be written in two ways: active voice and passive voice. Active voice emphasizes the doer of the action, such as 'Sarah baked the cake.' Passive voice shifts the focus to the receiver of the action, for example, 'The cake was baked by Sarah.' \n\nTo form the passive voice, use the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' plus the past participle of the main verb. For example, in the present tense, 'is' or 'are' is used: 'The letter is written.' In the past tense, 'was' or 'were' is used: 'The letters were written.' \n\nExamples:\n- Active: The teacher explains the lesson.\n- Passive: The lesson is explained by the teacher.\n\nPassive voice is often used when the focus is on the action or when the doer is unknown or unimportant. For example, in news reports: 'The city was affected by the storm.'\n\nRemember, not all sentences should be in passive voice. Use it when it adds clarity or emphasizes the receiver of the action.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American English, passive voice is commonly used in formal writing, news reports, and scientific contexts. While it can sometimes make sentences sound more impersonal, overuse may reduce clarity. Americans value directness, so active voice is often preferred in everyday conversation, but understanding passive constructions is vital for comprehensive communication especially in professional and academic settings.",
