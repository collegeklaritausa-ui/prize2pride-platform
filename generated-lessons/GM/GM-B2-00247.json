  "content": "The passive voice is a vital aspect of American English, especially in formal writing, journalism, and scientific communication. It shifts focus from the doer to the action or recipient. To form the passive voice, use the appropriate form of 'to be' plus the past participle of the main verb.\n\n**Structure:**\n- Active: Subject + verb + object\n- Passive: Object + form of 'to be' + past participle + (by + agent)\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The chef prepared the meal.\n- Passive: The meal was prepared by the chef.\n\nIn the passive voice, the emphasis is on 'the meal,' making it useful when the doer is unknown, unimportant, or implied.\n\n**Conversion tips:**\n- Identify the object in an active sentence.\n- Make that object the subject of the new sentence.\n- Use the correct form of 'to be' matching the tense.\n- Add the past participle of the main verb.\n- Optionally, include the agent with 'by.'\n\n**Common passive constructions in American English:**\n- News reports: 'The bill was passed yesterday.'\n- Scientific writing: 'The experiment was conducted by the researchers.'\n- Formal correspondence: 'Your application has been reviewed.'\n\nMastering the passive voice enhances your ability to write with variety, formality, and precision, making you a true GOD of American English grammar.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American professional and academic environments, the passive voice is often used to maintain objectivity and formality. It allows the speaker or writer to focus on actions and results rather than individuals, aligning with the cultural value placed on professionalism, neutrality, and clarity. However, overuse can lead to vague or impersonal writing, so balance is key. Understanding when and how to employ passive constructions is essential for mastering effective communication in the U.S.",
