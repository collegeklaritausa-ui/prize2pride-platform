  "content": "Welcome to your journey to becoming a GOD of American English grammar! Conjunctions are the glue that holds your sentences together, allowing you to express complex ideas with clarity and style.\n\nTypes of Conjunctions:\n1. Coordinating Conjunctions: These connect words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance. Remember the acronym FANBOYS: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So.\n   - Example: I wanted to go hiking, but it started to rain.\n\n2. Subordinating Conjunctions: These connect a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing contrast, cause, or time.\n   - Example: We stayed indoors because it was snowing.\n   - Common subordinators include: although, because, since, unless, while.\n\n3. Correlative Conjunctions: These work in pairs to join similar ideas.\n   - Example: Either you apologize, or you will be punished.\n   - Common pairs: either...or, neither...nor, both...and, not only...but also.\n\nUsing Conjunctions:\n- To combine ideas smoothly, choose the appropriate conjunction based on the relationship between the clauses.\n- Ensure that the sentence structure remains clear and logical.\n- Avoid overusing conjunctions; sometimes, breaking sentences into shorter parts improves readability.\n\nExamples:\n- Coordinating: She loves to read, and she writes poetry.\n- Subordinating: Although he was tired, he finished his homework.\n- Correlative: Neither the manager nor the employees were aware of the issue.\n\nRemember, mastery of conjunctions allows you to craft sentences that are not only correct but also compelling and nuanced.",
