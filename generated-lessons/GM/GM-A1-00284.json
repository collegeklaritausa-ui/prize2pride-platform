  "content": "Welcome to the lesson on Reported Speech, an essential part of mastering American English! When we want to share what someone else has said, we use reported speech. It helps us communicate information clearly without quoting everything precisely.\n\n**Direct Speech vs. Indirect Speech:**\n- Direct speech uses exact words, usually with quotation marks. Example: She said, \"I am happy.\"\n- Indirect speech reports what was said, often changing the tense and pronouns. Example: She said that she was happy.\n\n**Steps to Convert Direct Speech to Reported Speech:**\n1. Remove the quotation marks.\n2. Change the tense of the verb (present becomes past, past becomes past perfect if necessary).\n3. Adjust pronouns to match the reporting context.\n4. Add words like \"that\" to introduce the reported speech.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: \"I am learning English,\" he said.\n- Reported: He said that he was learning English.\n\n**Special notes:**\n- When the reporting verb is in the present tense, the tense in reported speech may stay the same.\n- When reporting questions, change the question form to a statement form.\n\n**Practice transforms your communication skills, making you a true GOD of American English!**",
