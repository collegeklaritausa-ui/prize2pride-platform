  "content": "Welcome to the realm of conjunctions! These small but mighty words are the glue that holds your sentences together, making your speech and writing fluid and expressive. In American English, conjunctions serve to connect words, phrases, and clauses, allowing you to build complex and engaging sentences.\n\n**Types of Conjunctions:**\n- **Coordinating Conjunctions:** These connect words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance. The most common are **and**, **but**, **or**, **nor**, **for**, **yet**, and **so**.\n- **Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce dependent clauses and show the relationship between the dependent and independent parts. Examples include **because**, **although**, **since**, **if**, and **when**.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Coordinating: *I want pizza **and** soda.*\n- Subordinating: *I stayed home **because** it was raining.*\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly helps you create clear and well-structured sentences. For example, instead of saying, *I like tea. I like coffee,* you can say, *I like tea **and** coffee.*\n\nRemember, mastering conjunctions is key to becoming a fluent speaker. Practice combining ideas smoothly and confidently!\n",
