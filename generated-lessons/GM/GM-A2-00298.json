  "content": "In American English, reported speech is used when you want to tell someone what another person said. Instead of quoting exactly, you can rephrase the sentence. For example, if someone says, \"I love pizza,\" you can say, \"She said she loved pizza.\" \n\n**Direct Speech** is the original words spoken, placed inside quotation marks. Example: \"I am going to the store,\" John said.\n\n**Reported Speech** is what someone said, but without quotation marks. Example: John said he was going to the store.\n\n**Key Rules:**\n- Change the tense of the verb in the sentence:\n  - Present Simple → Past Simple\n  - Present Continuous → Past Continuous\n  - Present Perfect → Past Perfect\n  - Past Simple → Past Perfect\n- Change pronouns and time expressions if necessary. \n  - \"I\" becomes \"he\" or \"she\".\n  - \"Today\" becomes \"that day\".\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: \"I am happy,\" she said.\n- Reported: She said she was happy.\n\n- Direct: \"We will go tomorrow,\" they said.\n- Reported: They said they would go the next day.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Keep practicing converting direct speech to reported speech to become a true master!\n",
