  "content": "Welcome to your lesson on Sentence Structure! In American English, a simple sentence is the easiest type of sentence. It has two main parts: the subject and the predicate. \n\n**Subject:** This is who or what the sentence is about. For example, in 'The cat sleeps,' **The cat** is the subject. \n\n**Predicate:** This tells what the subject does or is. In 'The cat sleeps,' **sleeps** is the predicate.\n\n**Example of a simple sentence:**\n- 'The boy plays.'\n- 'She reads.'\n- 'Dogs bark.'\n\n**Tips for creating simple sentences:**\n- Start with a capital letter.\n- Use a subject (who or what). \n- Add a predicate (what they do or are).\n- End with a period.\n\nRemember, keeping sentences simple helps your message be clear and easy to understand! Now, let’s practice together to become GODS of American English sentence structure!",
