  "content": "Welcome to the world of American English grammar! Today, we're focusing on the passive voice, a useful way to emphasize the action or the object rather than the subject. In active voice, the subject performs the action, like 'The dog chased the cat.' In passive voice, the focus shifts to the receiver of the action, such as 'The cat was chased by the dog.' \n\nForming the passive voice involves a few steps:\n1. Identify the object of the active sentence.\n2. Use the correct form of 'to be' + past participle of the main verb.\n3. Include the original subject after 'by,' if necessary.\n\nFor example:\nActive: The teacher grades papers.\nPassive: Papers are graded by the teacher.\n\nRemember, passive voice is often used in formal writing, news reports, and when the doer of the action is unknown or irrelevant. Practice switching sentences from active to passive to become comfortable using this structure in your everyday communication.",
