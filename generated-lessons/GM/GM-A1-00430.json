  "content": "Prepositions are small words that link nouns or pronouns to other parts of the sentence, providing important details about location, time, or movement. For example, in the sentence 'The cat is under the table,' the preposition 'under' shows the location of the cat. Common prepositions in American English include 'in,' 'on,' 'at,' 'by,' 'to,' 'from,' 'with,' and 'about.'\n\nPrepositions of place tell us where something is: 'in,' 'on,' 'at,' 'beside.' For example, 'The keys are in the drawer.'\n\nPrepositions of time tell us when something happens: 'at,' 'on,' 'in.' For example, 'We have a meeting at 5 p.m.'\n\nPrepositions of movement or direction include 'to,' 'from,' 'toward,' 'through.' For example, 'She is walking to the store.'\n\nRemember, prepositions are always followed by a noun or pronoun. Practice using them to describe where, when, and how actions happen to become a master of American English grammar!",
