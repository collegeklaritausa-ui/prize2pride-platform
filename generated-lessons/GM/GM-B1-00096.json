  "content": "Conditionals are essential in American English for expressing actions dependent on other conditions. There are four main types:\n\n1. Zero Conditional: Used for facts and general truths. \n   - Structure: If + present simple, present simple.\n   - Example: If you mix red and blue, you get purple.\n\n2. First Conditional: Used for real and possible situations in the future.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, will + base verb.\n   - Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will stay indoors.\n\n3. Second Conditional: Used for unreal or hypothetical situations in the present or future.\n   - Structure: If + past simple, would + base verb.\n   - Example: If I won the lottery, I would buy a house.\n\n4. Third Conditional: Used for unreal past situations, often expressing regret.\n   - Structure: If + past perfect, would have + past participle.\n   - Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.\n\nNote: In American English, contractions are common in conditional sentences, making speech sound natural: 'If you’re hungry, I’ll make a sandwich.'\n\nUnderstanding the nuances between these types helps you communicate more precisely whether discussing facts, possibilities, or regrets, making your American English sound authentic and confident.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, conditionals are often used in everyday conversations, advertisements, and media. For example, companies might say, 'If you buy now, you'll get a discount,' encouraging immediate action. Additionally, the relaxed and conversational nature of American English means that contractions and casual phrases are common in conditional sentences, helping learners sound more natural. Understanding how to use conditionals confidently enhances your ability to participate in American social, professional, and cultural contexts effectively.",
