  "content": "Welcome to Lesson #30: Mastering Verb Tenses. In American English, understanding verb tenses is crucial for expressing time accurately and making your speech and writing clear and effective.\n\n**1. Present Tense:** Used for habitual actions, general truths, and current states.\n- *Examples:* I walk to school. She is a teacher.\n- *Tip:* Use 'am', 'is', 'are' with present participle for present progressive.\n\n**2. Past Tense:** Describes actions completed in the past.\n- *Regular verbs:* add -ed (e.g., walked, played).\n- *Irregular verbs:* change form (e.g., went, saw).\n- *Example:* They watched a movie yesterday.\n\n**3. Future Tense:** Indicates actions that will happen.\n- *Formation:* will + base verb.\n- *Example:* I will call you tomorrow.\n\n**4. Present Progressive:** Describes ongoing actions happening now.\n- *Formation:* am/is/are + verb ending in -ing.\n- *Example:* She is reading a book.\n\n**5. Present Perfect:** Connects past actions to the present.\n- *Formation:* have/has + past participle.\n- *Example:* I have finished my homework.\n\n**6. Past Perfect:** Describes a completed action before another past action.\n- *Formation:* had + past participle.\n- *Example:* They had left before I arrived.\n\n**7. Future Perfect:** Expresses an action that will be completed before a specific future time.\n- *Formation:* will have + past participle.\n- *Example:* By next year, she will have graduated.\n\n*Understanding and mastering these tenses allows you to communicate precisely about different times. Practice conjugating regular and irregular verbs, and pay attention to context to choose the correct tense.*",
