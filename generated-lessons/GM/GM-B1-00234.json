  "content": "Welcome to your journey to mastering the Passive Voice in American English! The passive voice shifts the focus from the doer of the action to the action itself or its recipient. This is especially useful in formal writing, scientific reports, or when the doer is unknown or unimportant.\n\n**Formation of Passive Voice:**\n- Use the appropriate form of the auxiliary verb 'be' (am, is, are, was, were, etc.).\n- Use the past participle of the main verb.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The chef prepares the meal.\n- Passive: The meal is prepared by the chef.\n\n**Steps to transform active to passive:**\n1. Identify the object of the active sentence.\n2. Move it to the subject position.\n3. Use the correct form of 'be' that matches the tense.\n4. Add the past participle of the main verb.\n5. (Optional) Include the original subject with 'by'.\n\n**Note:** Not all sentences are suitable for passive construction. Generally, verbs that take a direct object can be made passive.\n\n**Examples in context:**\n- Scientific report: 'Researchers discovered a new element.' → 'A new element was discovered by researchers.'\n- News headline: 'The government will announce new policies.' → 'New policies will be announced by the government.'\n\nAs you develop your passive voice skills, remember to use it judiciously. Overuse can lead to vague or impersonal writing, but it is powerful for emphasizing the action or the recipient.\n\nReady to become a passive voice GOD? Let's practice!",

  "culturalNotes": "In American professional and academic settings, passive voice is often used to emphasize the action or the object of a process, rather than the doer. For example, in scientific or technical writing, passive constructions like 'The experiment was conducted...' are common. Understanding and using passive voice appropriately can help you communicate more effectively in formal American English contexts, such as business reports, journal articles, and official statements.",
