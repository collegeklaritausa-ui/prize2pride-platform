  "content": "Welcome to the world of conjunctions—your key to connecting ideas smoothly! In American English, conjunctions are words that join parts of sentences to make your speech and writing clearer and more natural.\n\nThere are two main types of conjunctions: coordinating and subordinating. Today, we'll focus on coordinating conjunctions, which connect words or groups of words that are of equal importance.\n\nThe most common coordinating conjunctions are: 'and', 'but', 'or', 'nor', 'for', 'so', and 'yet'. Let's look at some examples:\n\n- She wants to go to the park, **and** she plans to bring her dog.\n- I like coffee, **but** I prefer tea.\n- Would you like apples **or** oranges?\n- He didn't see the sign, **for** he was distracted.\n- It was raining, **so** we stayed indoors.\n- She was tired, **yet** she finished her homework.\n\nUsing conjunctions helps you combine simple sentences into more complex and interesting ones. For example:\n\nSimple sentences:\n- I am hungry. I want to eat.\n\nWith conjunction:\n- I am hungry, **and** I want to eat.\n\nRemember, placing a comma before the conjunction improves the sentence's clarity.\n\nSubordinating conjunctions (like because, although, since) link dependent and independent clauses, but we'll cover those in a later lesson.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Start combining sentences using conjunctions to sound more natural and confident in American English.",
