  "content": "Mastering conjunctions is essential for crafting clear and cohesive sentences in American English. There are three main types:\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions**: These connect words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance. The most common are **and**, **but**, **or**, **nor**, **for**, **yet**, and **so**.\n\n   *Examples:* \n   - I wanted to visit the museum, **but** it was closed.\n   - She loves to read **and** write.\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions**: These introduce dependent clauses and show relationships like cause, contrast, or time.\n\n   *Examples:* \n   - **Because** it was late, we decided to leave.\n   - **Although** he was tired, he finished his homework.\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions**: These work in pairs to connect equivalent elements.\n\n   *Examples:* \n   - **Neither** the manager **nor** the employees knew about the change.\n   - **Either** you apologize **or** face the consequences.\n\nUsing conjunctions effectively makes your speech and writing more fluent and engaging. Remember to choose the right type based on the relationship you want to express between ideas.\n\nTip: Avoid overusing conjunctions; sometimes, breaking complex sentences into shorter ones improves clarity.",
