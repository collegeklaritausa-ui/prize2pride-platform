  "content": "Welcome to your journey of mastering prepositions, the connectors of American English! Prepositions are small but mighty words that show relationships between things, places, and times. They are essential for clear and precise communication.\n\nFor example, consider the sentence: 'The dog is under the table.' Here, 'under' is the preposition showing the location of the dog relative to the table.\n\nCommon prepositions include in, on, at, by, with, about, for, from, to, and of. Each preposition has specific usage rules:\n\n- 'In' is used for enclosed spaces or periods: 'She lives in New York.' / 'He will arrive in December.'\n- 'On' is used for surfaces and specific days: 'The book is on the shelf.' / 'Our meeting is on Monday.'\n- 'At' is used for specific points or locations: 'Meet me at the corner.' / 'She is good at tennis.'\n\nPrepositional phrases add detail and context: 'He walked across the street,' or 'She is interested in music.'\n\nBeware of common mistakes such as saying 'She is good in tennis' instead of 'She is good at tennis.'\n\nPractice makes perfect! Proper preposition use enhances your clarity and professionalism in American English.",

Additionally, idiomatic expressions with prepositions, such as 'on time' or 'at the same time,' are common in everyday speech, reflecting the cultural emphasis on punctuality and social connection.",
