  "content": "Welcome to the world of conjunctions! Conjunctions are the magic words that connect parts of sentences, making your communication smooth and clear. In American English, the most common conjunctions are coordinating and subordinating. \n\n**Coordinating Conjunctions** are fan favorites—they connect words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance.\n\nExamples:\n- I want to go to the park, **and** I will bring my dog.\n- She is tired, **but** she keeps working.\n\nRemember the FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so.\n\n**Subordinating Conjunctions** introduce dependent clauses—they make your sentences more detailed.\n\nExamples:\n- I stayed home **because** it was raining.\n- She smiled **when** she saw the gift.\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly helps you express ideas clearly and connect your thoughts seamlessly. Practice makes perfect, so let's try some exercises!\n",
