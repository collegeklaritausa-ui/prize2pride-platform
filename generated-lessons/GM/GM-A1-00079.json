Second Conditional: Used for hypothetical or unlikely present/future situations.\n   - Structure: If + past simple, would + verb\n   - Example: If I won the lottery, I would buy a new house.\n\n4. Third Conditional: Used for imaginary past situations.\n   - Structure: If + past perfect, would have + past participle\n   - Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the test.\n\n**Practice makes perfect!** Use these structures to talk about your own experiences and plans.
