  "content": "In American English, the passive voice is a powerful grammatical tool that shifts focus from the doer to the action or the recipient of the action. It is formed by combining a form of the verb 'to be' (am, is, are, was, were, be, been) with the past participle of the main verb. For example, in the active sentence 'The chef cooked the meal,' the focus is on the subject performing the action. In the passive voice, it becomes 'The meal was cooked by the chef,' emphasizing the meal as the recipient of the action.\n\nMastering the passive voice involves understanding when and how to use it effectively. Use it when the doer is unknown, irrelevant, or you want to emphasize the action or recipient. For example:\n- Unknown agent: 'The window was broken.'\n- Emphasizing the recipient: 'The proposal was accepted by the committee.'\n\nTransforming active sentences into passive voice requires identifying the object, making it the new subject, conjugating 'to be' accordingly, and converting the main verb into its past participle. Example:\nActive: 'They will complete the project tomorrow.'\nPassive: 'The project will be completed tomorrow.'\n\nRemember, passive constructions can sometimes make sentences less direct or more formal. Use them judiciously to enhance clarity and emphasis in your writing.\n\nIn American professional and casual contexts, mastering passive voice can help you articulate ideas with nuance and sophistication, making your communication more impactful.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, clarity and directness are highly valued, especially in professional settings. While passive voice is often viewed as less direct than active voice, it is frequently used in formal reports, scientific writing, and legal documents to emphasize objectivity and neutrality. Understanding when to use passive voice helps you communicate appropriately across diverse American contexts, from business meetings to casual conversations.",
