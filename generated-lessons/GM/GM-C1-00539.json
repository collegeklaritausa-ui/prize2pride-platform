  "content": "Welcome to the advanced realm of American English conjunction mastery. Conjunctions are the glue that holds your sentences together, enabling you to craft complex, nuanced ideas with clarity and style. Let's explore the major types:\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS):** These connect words or independent clauses of equal importance. For example:\n- She wanted to go for a walk, but it started raining.\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce dependent clauses, adding depth and detail. For example:\n- Even though he was tired, he continued working.\n- Common subordinating conjunctions include: although, because, since, unless, whereas, while.\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions:** These work in pairs to relate equal sentence parts. For example:\n- Neither the manager nor the assistant knew about the issue.\n- Both the manager and the assistant were present.\n\n4. **Conjunctive Adverbs:** These link independent clauses with a transition of thought, often separated by a semicolon. For example:\n- I wanted to leave early; however, I had to finish my report.\n- They studied hard; consequently, they aced the exam.\n\n**Stylistic Tips:**\n- Use conjunctions to show contrast (but, yet, however), cause and effect (because, therefore), or addition (and, also).\n- Avoid overusing conjunctions; vary sentence structures for engagement.\n- When combining clauses, ensure clarity by correctly placing commas and semicolons.\n\nBy mastering conjunctions, you elevate your writing from simple to sophisticated, enabling precise expression of complex ideas.\n",
