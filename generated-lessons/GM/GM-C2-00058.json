Future Tenses:**\n- *Simple Future:* Actions that will happen. *Example:* I **will travel** next summer.\n- *Future Continuous:* Ongoing future actions. *Example:* This time tomorrow, I **will be flying**.\n- *Future Perfect:* Actions completed before a future time. *Example:* By next year, he **will have graduated**.\n- *Future Perfect Continuous:* Duration of future actions up to a point. *Example:* By then, I **will have been working** here for five years.\n\n**4.

  "culturalNotes": "In American English, tense usage often reflects a focus on clarity and immediacy. Native speakers prefer straightforward tense structures, especially in everyday conversation, to ensure understanding. Recognizing idiomatic expressions and common phrases can also help you sound more natural. For example, Americans frequently use the present perfect tense to describe experiences, emphasizing relevance to the present moment, as in 'I have visited New York.' Mastering tense usage aligns your language with American cultural communication styles—confident, clear, and conversational.",
