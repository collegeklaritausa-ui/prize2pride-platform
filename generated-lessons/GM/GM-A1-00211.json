  "content": "Welcome, future Grammar Gods! Today, we dive into the world of passive voice—a powerful tool in American English that shifts the focus from who does the action to the action itself or the recipient of the action.\n\n**What is Passive Voice?**\nIn active voice, the subject performs the action: \"The dog chased the cat.\"\nIn passive voice, the focus shifts to the recipient: \"The cat was chased by the dog.\"\n\n**How to Form the Passive Voice:**\n1. Identify the object of the active sentence.\n2. Use the correct form of the verb 'to be' (am, is, are, was, were).\n3. Add the past participle of the main verb.\n4. Optionally, include the doer of the action with 'by'.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: \"The teacher grades the tests.\"\n- Passive: \"The tests are graded by the teacher.\"\n\n**When to Use the Passive Voice:**\n- When the doer is unknown or unimportant.\n- To emphasize the action or the recipient.\n- In formal or scientific writing.\n\n**Practice is key!** Try converting active sentences into passive to become a true master.\n\nGet ready to become a GOD of American English passive constructions!",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, the passive voice is often used in formal writing, such as reports, scientific papers, and news reports. It can also be used to politely shift focus away from the doer, especially in business or diplomatic contexts. Recognizing passive constructions in American media helps you better understand the emphasis and tone of the message.",
