  "content": "Welcome to the world of reported speech, a crucial skill for mastering American English. Reported speech allows you to convey what someone else has said, often in a more indirect, polite, or formal way. When transforming direct quotes into reported speech, you'll need to pay attention to several rules: \n\n1. **Change of Tense**: Usually, the tense shifts back in time. For example, 'I am hungry' becomes 'He said he was hungry.' \n2. **Pronoun Adjustment**: Change pronouns to match the reporting subject. For example, 'I' becomes 'he' or 'she' depending on the context.\n3. **Time and Place Expressions**: Adjust expressions like 'today,' 'here,' and 'now' to reflect the reporting time and location ('that day,' 'there,' 'then').\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct speech: \"I will call you tomorrow.\"\n- Reported speech: She said she would call me the next day.\n\n**Common reporting verbs** include 'say,' 'tell,' 'explain,' and 'mention.' Remember that 'tell' is often followed by a person (e.g., 'He told me...'), while 'say' can be used more generally.\n\nLet's practice transforming sentences from direct to reported speech and vice versa to solidify your mastery.",
