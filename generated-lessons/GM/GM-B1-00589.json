  "content": "Welcome to the lesson on Sentence Structure, a crucial skill for mastering American English. Sentences are the foundation of clear communication, and understanding how they are constructed can dramatically improve your writing and speaking skills.\n\n**Basic Components of a Sentence:**\n- **Subject:** The person, place, thing, or idea performing the action.\n- **Predicate:** The part of the sentence that tells what the subject does or is.\n\n**Types of Sentence Structures:**\n1. **Simple Sentences:** Contain one independent clause.\n   - Example: \"The dog barked.\"\n2. **Compound Sentences:** Consist of two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so).\n   - Example: \"I wanted to go for a walk, but it started raining.\"\n3. **Complex Sentences:** Contain an independent clause and at least one dependent clause.\n   - Example: \"Although it was cold, we went hiking.\"\n\n**Constructing Sentences Correctly:**\n- Ensure subject-verb agreement.\n- Use appropriate conjunctions to connect ideas.\n- Vary sentence length and structure to make your writing more engaging.\n\n**Common Errors to Avoid:**\n- Sentence fragments: Incomplete sentences.\n- Run-on sentences: Combining multiple independent clauses without proper punctuation.\n- Misplaced modifiers that cause confusion.\n\nBy mastering these elements, you will be able to craft clear, effective, and stylistically diverse sentences that enhance your communication skills in American English.",
