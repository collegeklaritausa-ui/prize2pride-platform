  "content": "Welcome to the world of American English conditionals! These powerful sentences allow you to talk about real situations, make promises, give advice, or imagine unlikely scenarios. There are three main types:\n\n1. Zero Conditional: Used for facts and routines.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, + present simple.\n   - Example: If water reaches 100°C, it boils.\n\n2. First Conditional: Used for real future possibilities.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, + will + base verb.\n   - Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will cancel the picnic.\n\n3. Second Conditional: Used for hypothetical, unlikely, or impossible situations.\n   - Structure: If + past simple, + would + base verb.\n   - Example: If I won the lottery, I would buy a house.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Remember to use the correct tense in each part of the sentence and pay attention to the context — whether you're talking about facts, real possibilities, or imaginary situations. With these tools, you'll be speaking like a true American English master!\n",
