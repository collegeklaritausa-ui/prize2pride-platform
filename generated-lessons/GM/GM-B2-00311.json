  "content": "In American English, reported speech is an essential skill for effective communication, especially in formal and informal conversations, writing, and storytelling. When transforming direct speech into reported speech, several key rules apply:\n\n1. **Tense Shift:** Generally, the tense of the original speech shifts back in time. For example:\n   - Present simple to past simple: 'He says, \"I like coffee\"' becomes 'He said he liked coffee.'\n   - Present continuous to past continuous: 'She says, \"I am working\"' becomes 'She said she was working.'\n\n2. **Pronoun Change:** Adjust pronouns to match the reporting context:\n   - \"I\" becomes \"he\" or \"she.\"\n   - \"You\" becomes \"I\" or \"we\" depending on the speaker.\n\n3. **Time and Place Expressions:** Change expressions to reflect the reporting time:\n   - \"Today\" becomes \"that day\"\n   - \"Tomorrow\" becomes \"the next day\" or \"the following day\"\n   - \"Here\" becomes \"there\"\n\n4. **Reporting Verbs:** Choose appropriate verbs based on the context:\n   - 'Say,' 'tell,' 'explain,' 'ask,' 'suggest,' etc.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: She said, \"I will visit you tomorrow.\"\n- Reported: She said she would visit me the next day.\n\n- Direct: He asked, \"Are you coming to the party?\"\n- Reported: He asked if I was coming to the party.\n\nRemember, in American English, punctuation and intonation are crucial for clarity and natural flow. Mastering reported speech will elevate your communication skills, making you sound more confident and fluent.\"",
