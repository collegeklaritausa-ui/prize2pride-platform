  "content": "The passive voice shifts the focus from the doer of an action (the subject in an active sentence) to the recipient of the action (the subject in a passive sentence). It is formed using the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' + the past participle of the main verb. For example, active: 'The chef cooked the meal.' Passive: 'The meal was cooked by the chef.' \n\nActive sentences are often more direct and lively, but passive voice is useful for emphasizing the action or when the doer is unknown or unimportant. Recognizing passive voice involves identifying the 'to be' verb forms (am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been) combined with a past participle.\n\nExamples of transforming active to passive:\n- Active: The teacher explains the lesson.\n- Passive: The lesson is explained by the teacher.\n\nNote that not all sentences should be converted to passive; overuse can make writing dull or unclear. Use passive voice strategically to enhance clarity, objectivity, or formality in your communication.",
