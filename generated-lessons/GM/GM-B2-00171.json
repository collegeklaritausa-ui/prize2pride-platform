  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are essential tools that help us communicate attitudes, possibilities, permissions, and obligations. They are used alongside base verbs without 'to', such as 'can', 'may', 'must', 'should', 'might', and others.\n\n**Common Modal Verbs and Their Uses:**\n- **Can**: Express ability or possibility. \n  Example: *I can swim.* / *It can get very hot in July.*\n- **Could**: Past ability or polite possibility. \n  Example: *When I was young, I could run a mile in six minutes.*\n- **May**: Formal permission or possibility.\n  Example: *May I leave early today?* / *It may rain later.*\n- **Might**: Slight possibility.\n  Example: *We might go to the beach if the weather improves.*\n- **Must**: Strong obligation or logical conclusion.\n  Example: *You must wear a seatbelt.* / *He must be at work by now.*\n- **Should**: Advice or expectation.\n  Example: *You should see a doctor.*\n- **Would**: Polite requests or hypothetical situations.\n  Example: *Would you like some coffee?* / *If I were taller, I would play basketball.*\n- **Ought to**: Moral obligation or advice.\n  Example: *You ought to apologize.*\n\n**Modal Verbs in Different Contexts:**\n- **Requests:** *Could you help me?* / *May I use your phone?*\n- **Abilities:** *She can speak three languages.*\n- **Permissions:** *You may leave early today.*\n- **Obligations:** *Students must submit assignments on time.*\n- **Possibilities:** *It might snow tomorrow.*\n\n**Note:** Modal verbs do not take 's' in the third person singular and are followed directly by the base verb.\n\nUnderstanding how to correctly employ modal verbs dramatically increases your ability to express nuances and intentions clearly in American English.",
