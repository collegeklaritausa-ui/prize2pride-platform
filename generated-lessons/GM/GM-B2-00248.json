  "content": "In American English, passive voice is a grammatical tool used to shift focus from the doer of an action to the action itself or its recipient. It is formed using the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' followed by the past participle of the main verb.\n\n**Formation of Passive Voice:**\n- For present simple: Subject + is/are/am + past participle\n  - Active: The chef prepares the meal.\n  - Passive: The meal is prepared by the chef.\n- For past simple: Subject + was/were + past participle\n  - Active: The company launched the new product.\n  - Passive: The new product was launched by the company.\n- For future simple: Subject + will be + past participle\n  - Active: The team will complete the project.\n  - Passive: The project will be completed by the team.\n\n**When to Use Passive Voice:**\n- When the doer is unknown or unimportant.\n- To emphasize the action or the recipient.\n- In formal or scientific writing.\n\n**Transforming Active to Passive:**\n1. Identify the object of the active sentence.\n2. Make it the subject of the passive sentence.\n3. Use the correct form of 'to be' + past participle.\n4. (Optional) Include the original subject with 'by'.\n\n**Example:**\n- Active: The researcher conducted the experiment.\n- Passive: The experiment was conducted by the researcher.\n\n**Common Errors:**\n- Using the wrong form of 'to be'.\n- Forgetting the past participle.\n- Overuse of passive voice leading to vague or wordy sentences.\n\n**Tip:** Use passive voice judiciously to maintain clarity and style in your writing.\n\nBy mastering passive voice, you'll add variety and professionalism to your American English communication, transforming your language skills into true mastery.",
