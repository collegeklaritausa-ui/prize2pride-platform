  "content": "Welcome, future Gods of American English! Today, we conquer the art of reported speech, a key skill to sound natural and confident in conversations. In direct speech, you quote someone's exact words, like: \"I am hungry.\" But in reported speech, you relay what someone said without quoting directly, such as: She said she was hungry.\n\n**Key Rules:**\n1. Tense Shift: Usually, the present tense in direct speech changes to the past tense in reported speech.\n   - Present Simple ➔ Past Simple\n   - Present Continuous ➔ Past Continuous\n   - Present Perfect ➔ Past Perfect\n   - Past Simple ➔ Past Perfect\n\n2. Pronoun and Time/Place Adjustments: Change pronouns and time expressions to fit the context.\n   - \"I\" becomes \"he\" or \"she.\"\n   - \"Today\" becomes \"that day.\"\n   - \"Now\" becomes \"then.\"\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: \"I will call you tomorrow,\" she said.\n  Reported: She said she would call me the next day.\n- Direct: \"Are you coming to the party?\" he asked.\n  Reported: He asked if I was coming to the party.\n\n**Common Reporting Verbs:**\n- say, tell, ask, explain, suggest, admit\n\nBy mastering reported speech, you can confidently share stories and information, sounding like a true American English hero!\n\nRemember: Practice makes perfect. Use reported speech daily in conversations and writing to become fluent!",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, direct communication is often valued for its clarity and honesty. However, reported speech allows for polite indirect communication, especially in formal situations or when sharing news. Americans appreciate straightforwardness but also value tact and context awareness when relaying information. Mastery of reported speech helps you navigate both casual conversations and professional settings with confidence and cultural understanding.",
