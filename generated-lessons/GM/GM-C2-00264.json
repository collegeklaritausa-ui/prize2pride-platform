  "content": "The passive voice shifts the focus from who is performing an action to the action itself or its recipient. In American English, passive constructions are common in formal writing, journalism, and situations where the agent is unknown or unimportant.\n\n**Formation of Passive Voice:**\n- Use the appropriate form of the verb \"to be\" (am, is, are, was, were, be, been, being).\n- Follow with the past participle of the main verb.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The chef prepared the meal.\n- Passive: The meal was prepared by the chef.\n\n**When to Use the Passive Voice:**\n- When the focus is on the action or the recipient.\n- When the doer is unknown or irrelevant.\n- To create a formal tone.\n\n**Transforming Sentences:**\n- Active: The company will launch the new product.\n- Passive: The new product will be launched by the company.\n\n**Note:** While passive voice is useful, overuse can make writing vague or inefficient. Use it judiciously to enhance clarity and emphasis.\n\n**Common Passive Constructions:**\n- Present: The reports are reviewed weekly.\n- Past: The letters were sent yesterday.\n- Future: The project will be completed by next month.",
