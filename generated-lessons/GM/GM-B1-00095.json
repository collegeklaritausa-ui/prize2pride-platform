  "content": "Conditionals are essential in American English for expressing possibilities, hypotheses, and consequences. There are primarily three types:\n\n1. **First Conditional** (Real possibility): Used when the condition is likely to happen. \n   - Structure: If + present simple, ... will + base verb\n   - Example: If you study, you will pass the test.\n\n2. **Second Conditional** (Unreal or unlikely present/future): Used for hypothetical situations in the present or future.\n   - Structure: If + past simple, ... would + base verb\n   - Example: If I were taller, I would play basketball.\n\n3. **Third Conditional** (Unreal past): Used to talk about hypothetical situations in the past.\n   - Structure: If + past perfect, ... would have + past participle\n   - Example: If she had left earlier, she would have caught the bus.\n\nIn conversational American English, conditionals often blend formal structures with casual phrases. For instance, \"If I were you\" is a common way to give advice, even in informal settings.\n\nUnderstanding the nuances of conditionals allows you to express yourself more precisely and confidently, whether you're making plans, giving advice, or discussing hypothetical scenarios.",
