  "content": "Conjunctions are essential tools in American English that allow speakers and writers to connect ideas smoothly and logically. There are three main types:\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions**: These join two independent clauses or elements of equal importance. For example, 'I wanted to go for a walk, but it started raining.' Here, 'but' links two independent ideas.\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions**: These introduce subordinate clauses, providing context or condition to the main idea. For example, 'She stayed home because it was snowing.' The word 'because' shows the reason.\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions**: These work in pairs to balance the sentence. For example, 'Both the team and the coach were excited.'\n\n**Examples in sentences:**\n- Coordinating: 'He studies hard **and** participates in sports.'\n- Subordinating: '**Although** he was tired, he continued working.'\n- Correlative: '**Neither** the manager **nor** the employees knew about the change.'\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly enhances clarity, adds variety, and creates more sophisticated sentences—key to transforming your English into that of a true God!",
