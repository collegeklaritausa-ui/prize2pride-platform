  "content": "In American English, the passive voice is a powerful grammatical tool that shifts the focus from the doer of an action to the recipient or the action itself. It's particularly useful when the agent is unknown, unimportant, or deliberately omitted to emphasize the action.\n\n**Identifying Passive Voice:**\n- Look for a form of the verb \"to be\" (am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been) + the past participle of the main verb.\n- Example: \"The letter was mailed yesterday.\"\n\n**Active vs. Passive:**\n- Active: \"The chef prepared the meal.\"\n- Passive: \"The meal was prepared by the chef.\"\n\n**Transforming Active to Passive:**\n1. Make the object of the active sentence the subject of the passive sentence.\n2. Use the appropriate form of \"to be\" matching the tense.\n3. Add the past participle of the main verb.\n4. (Optional) Include the original subject preceded by \"by\".\n\nExample:\n- Active: \"The engineer designs the plans.\"\n- Passive: \"The plans are designed by the engineer.\"\n\n**Using Passive Voice Effectively:**\n- Use in formal writing, scientific reports, or when the actor is unknown.\n- Avoid overusing passive voice in casual conversation to maintain clarity.\n- Be mindful of tense consistency to ensure clarity.\n\n**Practice Tip:** Practice transforming active sentences into passive form regularly to build mastery and recognize passive structures effortlessly.",
