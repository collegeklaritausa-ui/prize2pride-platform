  "content": "In American English, reported speech allows us to relay what someone else has said, often in a more formal or indirect manner. When transforming direct speech into reported speech, key changes occur, especially in verb tenses, pronouns, and time expressions.\n\n**Tense Changes:** Generally, the tense shifts back in time when converting to reported speech: present simple changes to past simple, present perfect to past perfect, etc. For example:\n- Direct: 'I live in New York.'\n- Reported: She said she **lived** in New York.\n\n**Reporting Verbs:** Use 'say', 'tell', 'ask', 'explain', 'suggest', depending on context. Remember that 'tell' is usually followed by an object, e.g., 'He told me...' whereas 'say' often isn't.\n\n**Questions:** Convert direct questions into statements. Use 'ask' for yes/no questions and 'wonder' or 'if/whether' for those with question words:\n- Direct: 'Are you coming?'\n- Reported: She asked if I was coming.\n\n**Commands and Requests:** Use 'tell', 'ask', or 'advise' with an object:\n- Direct: 'Close the door!'\n- Reported: He told me to close the door.\n\n**Pronouns and Time Expressions:** Adjust pronouns and time references:\n- 'I' becomes 'he' or 'she'\n- 'Tomorrow' becomes 'the next day' or 'the following day'\n\nMastering these transformations will elevate your fluency and make your American English sound natural and confident.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, indirect speech and reporting are commonly used in both formal and informal contexts to convey information politely or diplomatically. Americans value clarity and conciseness, so mastering reported speech helps in effective communication, especially in professional settings, interviews, and everyday conversations. Understanding how to appropriately adjust time expressions and pronouns reflects cultural awareness and contributes to sounding natural and respectful.",
