  "content": "Mastering conjunctions elevates your command of American English, allowing you to craft sentences that are clear, nuanced, and sophisticated. Conjunctions serve as the glue holding your ideas together, enabling smooth transitions and complex relationships between thoughts.\n\nThere are three main types of conjunctions:\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions:** These connect words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance. The mnemonic FANBOYS helps remember them:\n   - For\n   - And\n   - Nor\n   - But\n   - Or\n   - Yet\n   - So\n\n   *Example:* \"She wanted to stay, but she had to leave early.\"\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce dependent clauses and show the relationship between the dependent clause and the main clause.\n\n   *Examples:* because, although, since, unless, while\n\n   *Example:* \"He stayed home because it was raining.\"\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions:** These work in pairs to connect equivalent sentence parts.\n\n   *Examples:* either...or, neither...nor, both...and, not only...but also\n\n   *Example:* \"You can either call me or send an email.\"\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly enhances your ability to form complex sentences, express contrasting ideas, provide reasons, and improve the flow of your speech and writing. Remember to avoid comma splices—using just a comma to connect two independent clauses—by employing appropriate conjunctions or punctuation.\n\nPractice linking ideas logically, and your mastery will make your American English both powerful and persuasive.",
