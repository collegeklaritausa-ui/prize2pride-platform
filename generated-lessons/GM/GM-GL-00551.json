  "content": "Welcome to the realm of conjunction mastery—where the power to link ideas elevates your mastery of American English to divine levels. Conjunctions are the essential threads weaving complex, nuanced, and stylistically rich sentences. \n\n**1. Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS):** These are the basic union builders, linking elements of equal grammatical rank. \n- *Example:* \"She wanted to go to the beach, but it started raining.\"\n- *Tip:* Use commas before coordinating conjunctions when connecting two independent clauses.\n\n**2. Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce dependent clauses, providing context, contrast, cause, or time.\n- *Example:* \"I'll call you when I arrive.\"\n- *Tip:* The subordinating conjunction begins the dependent clause; ensure correct placement to maintain sentence clarity.\n\n**3. Correlative Conjunctions:** Paired words that work in tandem to emphasize the relationship.\n- *Example:* \"Either you start studying, or you'll fail the test.\"\n- *Tip:* Balance your sentence with paired conjunctions to achieve symmetry and emphasis.\n\n**4. Advanced Conjunction Usage:** Combine conjunction types for sophisticated writing.\n- *Example:* \"Although she was exhausted, yet she continued to work, and she finished on time!\"\n- *Note:* Be cautious of overcomplicating; clarity is king.\n\n**5. Common Pitfalls and Corrections:** \n- *Incorrect:* \"She likes both to dance and she sings well.\"\n- *Correct:* \"She likes both to dance and to sing well.\"\n- *Incorrect:* \"He didn't study, so he failed the exam.\"\n- *Correct:* \"He didn't study, so he failed the exam.\"\n\nBy mastering these conjunctions, you command the flow and coherence of your speech and writing, transforming your language into a divine instrument of communication.",
