  "content": "In American English, conditionals help us talk about real and imagined situations. There are mainly two types:\n\n1. Zero Conditional: Used for facts or routines.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, present simple.\n   - Example: If you study hard, you pass the test.\n\n2. First Conditional: Used for real future possibilities.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, will + base verb.\n   - Example: If it rains today, we will cancel the picnic.\n\nRemember, in American English, we often use contractions like 'I'll' instead of 'I will' in spoken language. Also, the word 'if' is always followed by a verb in the present simple tense.\n\nExamples:\n- Zero conditional: If you don't water plants, they die.\n- First conditional: If you see John, tell him to call me.\n\nPracticing these will make your sentences clear and natural in everyday conversations!",
