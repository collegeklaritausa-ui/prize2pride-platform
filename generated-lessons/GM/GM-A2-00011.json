  "content": "Welcome to your first step toward becoming a GOD of American English! Today, we will learn about three basic verb tenses: present, past, and future.\n\n1. Present Tense:\nThe present tense tells us what happens regularly or what is happening now. For most verbs, add an 's' or 'es' in the third person singular.\n- Example: I walk, You walk, He walks.\n\n2. Past Tense:\nThe past tense describes actions that already happened. For regular verbs, add '-ed' at the end.\n- Example: I walked, She played.\nNote: Some verbs are irregular and do not follow this rule (e.g., go → went, see → saw).\n\n3. Future Tense:\nThe future tense is used to talk about what will happen. Use 'will' + verb.\n- Example: I will help, They will arrive.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Mastering these tenses allows you to speak about your daily routines, past experiences, and future plans with confidence.",
