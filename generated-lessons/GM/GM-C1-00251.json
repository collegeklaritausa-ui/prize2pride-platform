  "content": "Welcome to the pinnacle of grammatical mastery—advanced passive voice. Unlike basic transformations, mastering this skill involves understanding subtle nuances that can elevate your communication to a professional level.\n\n**Structure and Nuance:**\nPassive voice is formed by combining a suitable form of the verb 'to be' with the past participle of the main verb. For advanced mastery, pay attention to tense consistency and the appropriate use of 'by' to introduce the agent.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Present perfect passive: \"The documents have been reviewed by the committee.\"\n- Future passive: \"The results will be announced by the organizers.\"\n- Past perfect passive: \"The project had been completed before the deadline.\"\n\n**Transforming Sentences:**\n- Active: \"The CEO is analyzing the data.\"\n- Passive: \"The data is being analyzed by the CEO.\"\n\n**Special Cases:**\n- When the agent is unknown or irrelevant, omit 'by' and the agent.\n- Use passive voice to shift focus, especially in scientific, formal, or journalistic writing.\n\n**Advanced Tips:**\n- Modulate the tone by choosing the appropriate tense and voice.\n- Be cautious with complex tenses like perfect continuous, which are rarely used in passive form.\n- Recognize when passive voice enhances clarity versus when it causes ambiguity.\n\nBy mastering these elements, you will wield passive voice with sophistication, ensuring your writing is both precise and compelling.",
