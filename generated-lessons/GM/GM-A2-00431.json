  "content": "Prepositions are small words that connect nouns or pronouns to other words in a sentence, showing relationships such as location, direction, or time. In American English, prepositions help clarify where something is or where it is going. For example, in the sentence 'The cat is on the sofa,' the preposition 'on' tells us the location of the cat.\n\nCommon prepositions at the elementary level include 'in,' 'on,' 'under,' 'next to,' and 'behind.' These words help students describe everyday scenes and actions clearly. Practice makes perfect: try to use these prepositions to describe your own environment. Remember, the choice of preposition depends on what you want to express about position or movement.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, clarity in communication is valued, especially in directions and location descriptions. Prepositions like 'next to' are frequently used in everyday conversations to specify close proximity, such as 'The restaurant is next to the bank.' Understanding and correctly using prepositions helps with both social interactions and navigating American environments, from asking for directions to describing your surroundings.",
