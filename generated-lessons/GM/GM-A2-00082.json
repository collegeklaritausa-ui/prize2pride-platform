  "content": "Welcome to the world of conditionals in American English! Conditionals are sentences that tell us what happens if something occurs. They are essential for expressing real and imaginary situations.\n\n**Zero Conditional**: Use for facts and things that are always true. \n- Structure: If + simple present, simple present.\n- Example: If you press this button, the machine starts.\n\n**First Conditional**: Use for real or likely future situations.\n- Structure: If + simple present, will + base verb.\n- Example: If it is sunny tomorrow, we will go to the park.\n\n**Second Conditional**: Use for imaginary or unlikely present or future situations.\n- Structure: If + simple past, would + base verb.\n- Example: If I had a car, I would drive to work.\n\nRemember, in American English, the word 'if' is always lowercase in the middle of a sentence. Use contractions like 'won't' for 'will not' and 'wouldn't' for 'would not' to sound natural.\n\nLet's practice forming these conditionals and see how they are used in everyday life, from weather plans to dreams and wishes!",
