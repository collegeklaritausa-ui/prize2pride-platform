  "content": "Prepositions are essential in American English as they help specify relationships of location, direction, time, and more. For example, in the sentence 'The cat is **under** the table,' the preposition 'under' indicates the position of the cat relative to the table. Common prepositions include 'in,' 'on,' 'at,' 'by,' 'with,' 'about,' 'for,' and 'to.'\n\nUnderstanding how prepositions work involves recognizing their placement and function within sentences. Prepositions are usually followed by a noun or pronoun called the object of the preposition, forming a prepositional phrase. For example, in 'She arrived **after the meeting**,' the prepositional phrase 'after the meeting' indicates when she arrived.\n\nIt's crucial to use prepositions correctly to avoid confusion. For instance, saying 'She is interested **on** music' is incorrect; it should be 'She is interested **in** music.'\n\nIn American English, prepositions often appear in set phrases and idiomatic expressions, such as 'look **forward to**' or 'be **about to**' happen. Mastery of prepositions enhances both your clarity and stylistic finesse in communication.",

  "culturalNotes": "Prepositions in American English often appear in idiomatic expressions that reflect cultural norms and everyday life. For example, Americans frequently use prepositions like 'on' and 'in' when talking about time, such as 'on Monday' or 'in the morning,' highlighting the importance of punctuality and routine in American culture. Additionally, prepositional phrases are common in casual speech, enhancing friendliness and informality. Mastering prepositions not only improves grammatical accuracy but also helps you understand and participate in American social and cultural contexts with confidence.",
