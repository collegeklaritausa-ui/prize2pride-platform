  "content": "Welcome to the world of prepositions, the tiny words that hold big power in English! Prepositions link nouns or pronouns to other words, giving us information about location, time, and direction. Mastering prepositions helps make your speech clearer and more natural.\n\nCommon prepositions of place include: **on**, **in**, **under**, **next to**, **between**.\nExamples:\n- The keys are **in** the drawer.\n- The cat is **under** the table.\n\nPrepositions of time include: **at**, **on**, **in**.\nExamples:\n- The meeting is **at** 9 AM.\n- My birthday is **on** Monday.\n- We go on vacation **in** July.\n\nPrepositions of direction include: **to**, **toward**, **into**, **onto**.\nExamples:\n- She is walking **to** the store.\n- The children ran **into** the park.\n\nRemember, prepositions are followed by a noun or pronoun, which we call the object of the preposition.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Use prepositions in your daily conversations and writing to become more fluent and natural in American English.",
