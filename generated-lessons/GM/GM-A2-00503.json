  "content": "Welcome to the world of conjunctions! Conjunctions are words that link different parts of a sentence, making your thoughts clear and connected. In American English, some common conjunctions are 'and,' 'but,' 'or,' 'nor,' 'for,' 'yet,' and 'so.'\n\nFor example:\n- 'I want to go outside, but it is raining.' Here, 'but' connects two ideas.\n- 'She likes coffee and tea.' Here, 'and' connects two items.\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly helps you create smooth, understandable sentences. Let’s look at the main types:\n1. Coordinating conjunctions: connect equal ideas (and, but, or, nor, for, yet, so)\n2. Subordinating conjunctions: connect a dependent clause to an independent clause (because, although, since, unless)\n\nPractice makes perfect! Try combining sentences using conjunctions to show relationships like addition, contrast, or choice.",
