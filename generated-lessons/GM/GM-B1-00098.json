  "content": "In American English, conditionals are essential for expressing different kinds of situations, from facts to hypothetical scenarios. There are four main types:\n\n1. Zero Conditional: Used for general truths or facts.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, ... present simple.\n   - Example: If you heat water to 100°C, it boils.\n\n2. First Conditional: Used for real or possible future situations.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, ... will + base verb.\n   - Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will stay indoors.\n\n3. Second Conditional: Used for hypothetical or unlikely present/future situations.\n   - Structure: If + past simple, ... would + base verb.\n   - Example: If I were you, I would apologize.\n\n4. Third Conditional: Used for hypothetical situations in the past.\n   - Structure: If + past perfect, ... would have + past participle.\n   - Example: If I had known, I would have told you.\n\nUnderstanding the nuances between these conditionals allows you to express yourself more precisely and confidently in American English. Practice forming each type with the provided examples to internalize their usage.",
