  "content": "Welcome to the world of passive voice! In American English, sentences can be structured in two main ways: active and passive. In active voice, the subject performs the action: 'The dog eats the food.' In passive voice, the focus shifts to the action itself or the receiver: 'The food is eaten by the dog.' \n\nPassive voice is useful when the doer of the action is unknown, unimportant, or when you want to emphasize the action or recipient.\n\n**Forming the Passive Voice:**\n\n- Use the correct form of the verb 'to be' (am, is, are, was, were, will be, etc.).\n- Add the past participle of the main verb.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: \"The teacher grades the papers.\"\n- Passive: \"The papers are graded by the teacher.\"\n\n**Practice:**\nTransform the following active sentences into passive:\n1. The chef cooks the meal.\n2. They will finish the project.\n3. The children play soccer.\n\nRemember, passive voice is common in formal writing, notices, and when the focus is on the action or object rather than the doer.\n\nBy mastering passive voice, you will be able to add variety to your sentences and understand more complex English structures!",
