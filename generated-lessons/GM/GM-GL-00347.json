  "content": "Mastering reported speech is essential for elevating your American English proficiency to GOD-LEVEL. In American conversations, especially in storytelling, journalism, and professional settings, accurately conveying what others have said is crucial.\n\n**Basic Structure**: To convert direct speech into reported speech, follow these rules:\n\n1. **Tense Shift**: Most tenses shift back one step in reported speech:\n   - Present simple → Past simple\n   - Present continuous → Past continuous\n   - Present perfect → Past perfect\n   - Past simple → Past perfect\n2. **Pronoun Adjustment**: Change pronouns to match the perspective of the reporter:\n   - ‘I’ → ‘he/she/they’\n   - ‘You’ → ‘I’ or ‘they’ depending on context\n3. **Time and Place Expressions**: Adjust these expressions:\n   - ‘Today’ → ‘That day’\n   - ‘Tomorrow’ → ‘The next day’\n   - ‘Here’ → ‘There’\n\n**Examples**:\n- Direct: She said, ‘I am learning American English.’\n- Reported: She said that she was learning American English.\n\n**Advanced Techniques**:\n- Use of reporting verbs like ‘claim,’ ‘explain,’ ‘admit,’ ‘deny,’ and ‘insist’ to add nuance.\n- Embedding reported speech within complex sentences for storytelling.\n\nIn American culture, reported speech often underpins storytelling, journalism, and everyday conversations. Being precise and adaptable in reporting what others say demonstrates mastery and cultural fluency.\n\nPractice regularly by transforming dialogues, speeches, and news reports into reported speech to reinforce these rules.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, storytelling and direct communication often involve reporting speech to emphasize honesty or clarify intentions. News reports, interviews, and casual conversations frequently rely on indirect speech to maintain a conversational flow and demonstrate cultural fluency. Mastery of reported speech reflects not only grammatical precision but also cultural understanding of indirect communication styles prevalent in the U.S.",
