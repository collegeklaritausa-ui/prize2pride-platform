  "content": "Welcome to the world of reported speech! In American English, reported speech allows us to share what someone else has said without quoting them directly. It’s commonly used in conversations, news, and storytelling. To transform direct speech into reported speech, follow these simple steps:\n\n1. **Identify the reporting verb:** Common verbs include 'say', 'tell', 'ask'.\n2. **Change the tense of the verb:** Past tense is often used in reported speech.\n3. **Adjust pronouns and time expressions:** Change 'I' to 'he/she', 'today' to 'that day', etc.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: She said, 'I am tired.'\n- Reported: She said that she was tired.\n\n- Direct: John told me, 'Can you help me?'\n- Reported: John asked if I could help him.\n\n**Important Rules:**\n- When reporting questions, use 'ask' and invert the sentence structure if necessary.\n- Be mindful of tense shifts to accurately reflect the original statement.\n\nBy mastering these principles, you'll confidently report conversations and improve your clarity in communication!",
