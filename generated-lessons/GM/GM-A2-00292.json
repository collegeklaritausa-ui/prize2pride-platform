  "content": "Welcome to your journey on mastering Reported Speech, an essential skill to become a true GOD of American English! Reported speech is used when we tell someone else what another person has said, without quoting exactly. For example, instead of saying, 'She said, \"I am tired.\"', we can say, 'She said she was tired.'\n\nRemember these key points:\n- When converting direct speech into reported speech, verb tenses often change. For example, present tense changes to past tense.\n- Use reporting verbs like 'say', 'tell', 'ask' to introduce reported speech.\n- Be careful with pronouns and time expressions. For example, 'today' may change to 'that day'.\n\nExamples:\nDirect speech: John said, \"I am happy.\"\nReported speech: John said that he was happy.\n\nDirect speech: Mary asked, \"Are you coming?\"\nReported speech: Mary asked if I was coming.\n\nTransforming sentences:\n- Change tense: 'I am' becomes 'he was'.\n- Change pronouns: 'I' becomes 'he' or 'she'.\n- Remove quotation marks and add 'that' or 'if' for questions.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Keep practicing converting direct to reported speech to become a MASTER!",
