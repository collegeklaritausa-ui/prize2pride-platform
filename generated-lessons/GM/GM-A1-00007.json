  "content": "Welcome to Lesson 7: Verb Tenses – the foundation of clear communication in English!\n\nToday, we'll focus on two essential present tense forms: the Present Simple and the Present Continuous.\n\n**Present Simple**\n- Structure: Subject + base verb (+ s/es for third person singular)\n- Usage:\n  - To describe habits and routines (e.g., I eat breakfast every morning.)\n  - To state facts (e.g., The sun rises in the east.)\n  - To express general truths (e.g., Water boils at 100°C.)\n\n**Examples:**\n- I work in downtown Chicago.\n- She plays soccer on weekends.\n- They live near the park.\n\n**Present Continuous**\n- Structure: Subject + am/is/are + verb ending in -ing\n- Usage:\n  - To describe actions happening right now (e.g., She is cooking dinner.)\n  - To talk about temporary situations (e.g., I am staying with a friend this week.)\n  - To describe changing or developing situations (e.g., The weather is getting colder.)\n\n**Examples:**\n- I am studying for my English test.\n- He is working on a project today.\n- We are watching a movie now.\n\nUnderstanding the difference:\n- Use Present Simple for routines and facts.\n- Use Present Continuous for actions happening right now.\n\nLet's look at some quick tips:\n- Add 's' or 'es' for third person singular in Present Simple.\n- Use 'am,' 'is,' or 'are' + verb + -ing' to form Present Continuous.\n\nPractice makes perfect!
