  "content": "The passive voice is a vital aspect of English grammar, allowing speakers to focus on the action or the recipient rather than the doer. In American English, passive constructions are frequently used in formal writing, journalism, and scientific reports.\n\n**Structure of Passive Voice:**\n\n- The subject receives the action.\n- The form of 'to be' verb (am, is, are, was, were, etc.) matches the tense.\n- The main verb is in the past participle form.\n- Optionally, the agent is included after 'by'.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The chef cooks the meal.\n- Passive: The meal is cooked by the chef.\n\n**Conversion Tips:**\n- Identify the object of the active sentence.\n- Make it the subject of the passive sentence.\n- Use the correct form of 'to be' plus the past participle of the main verb.\n- Include the agent with 'by' if necessary.\n\n**Special Cases:**\n- When the agent is unknown or irrelevant, omit 'by'.\n- Passive voice can sometimes make sentences more formal or impersonal.\n\n**Common Tenses in Passive Voice:**\n- Present: The reports are prepared daily.\n- Past: The documents were signed yesterday.\n- Future: The results will be published soon.\n\nMastery of passive voice enhances clarity, professionalism, and versatility in American English, empowering you to craft nuanced and polished sentences.",
