  "content": "In American English, conjunctions are essential tools that connect different parts of sentences, making your communication clearer and more fluent. There are two main types: coordinating conjunctions and subordinating conjunctions.\n\n**Coordinating Conjunctions:** These connect words, phrases, or independent clauses that are of equal importance. The most common coordinating conjunctions are 'for,' 'and,' 'nor,' 'but,' 'or,' 'yet,' and 'so'—often remembered by the acronym FANBOYS.\n\n*Examples:* \n- I want to go to the park, **and** I will bring my dog.\n- She is tired, **but** she still finished her homework.\n\n**Subordinating Conjunctions:** These connect a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing relationships like cause, time, or condition.\n\n*Examples:*\n- I stayed inside **because** it was raining.\n- Call me **when** you arrive.\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly will help you create complex and compound sentences, making your speech and writing more engaging and natural. Practice identifying and using these words in your sentences to become a true grammar master!",
