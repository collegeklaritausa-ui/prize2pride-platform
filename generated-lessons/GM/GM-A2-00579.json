  "content": "Welcome to the world of American English sentence structure! In this lesson, we will learn how to build simple, clear sentences. Every sentence has two main parts: the subject (who or what the sentence is about) and the predicate (what the subject does or is). For example, in the sentence 'The cat sleeps,' 'The cat' is the subject, and 'sleeps' is the predicate.\n\nRemember to start each sentence with a capital letter and end it with the correct punctuation mark, such as a period, question mark, or exclamation point. For example: 'He runs fast.' or 'Do you like pizza?'\n\nSometimes, sentences can be incomplete. For example, 'Running in the park.' is not a complete sentence because it lacks a subject. To fix it, add a subject: 'She is running in the park.'\n\nPractice makes perfect! The goal is to create sentences that are complete, correctly structured, and easy to understand. With these basics, you are well on your way to mastering American English sentence structure!\n\nNow, let's look at some examples:\n- Correct: 'The children play outside.'\n- Incorrect: 'Play outside.' (missing subject)\n- Corrected: 'The children play outside.'\n\nKeep practicing by forming sentences about your daily activities, family, or favorite things. The more you practice, the more confident you will become!",
