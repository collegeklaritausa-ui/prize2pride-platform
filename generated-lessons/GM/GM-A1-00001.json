  "content": "Welcome to your journey to becoming a GOD of American English! Today, we focus on verb tenses, the backbone of clear communication.\n\n**What are verb tenses?**\nVerb tenses tell us when an action happens: now, before now, or later.\n\n**Present Tense:**\n- Used for actions happening now or regular routines.\n- Example: I work every day.\n\n**Past Tense:**\n- Used for actions that already happened.\n- Example: I watched a movie yesterday.\n\n**Future Tense:**\n- Used for actions that will happen.\n- Example: I will go to the park tomorrow.\n\n**Forming the tenses:**\n- Present: base form of the verb (add 's' for he/she/it).\n- Past: add '-ed' for regular verbs.\n- Future: 'will' + base verb.\n\n**Quick tip:** Be mindful of irregular verbs like 'go' (went), 'buy' (bought), which do not follow regular patterns.\n\nPractice makes perfect. Mastering these tenses will make your speech clear and confident!",
