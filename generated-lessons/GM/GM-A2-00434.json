  "content": "Welcome to the world of prepositions! Prepositions are small words that connect nouns or pronouns to other parts of the sentence, giving us important details about location, direction, time, and relationships. In American English, common prepositions include 'in,' 'on,' 'at,' 'under,' 'over,' 'next to,' 'between,' and 'behind.'\n\nFor example, in the sentence 'The cat is under the table,' the preposition 'under' shows where the cat is.\n\nLet's look at some examples:\n- Location: The keys are in the drawer.\n- Direction: Go straight ahead and turn right.\n- Time: The meeting is at 3 PM.\n\nPrepositions help make our sentences clear and precise. Remember, a preposition is usually followed by a noun or pronoun, called the object of the preposition. For example, 'on the wall,' 'under the bridge,' 'at the store.'\n\nPractice using prepositions to describe where things are or where you are going. Think about your daily environment and try to describe it using prepositions! For example: 'My backpack is next to my chair,' or 'The ball rolled under the sofa.'",
