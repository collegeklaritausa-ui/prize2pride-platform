  "content": "Conjunctions are essential tools in American English that allow speakers and writers to connect ideas smoothly and logically. Understanding how to use different types of conjunctions will elevate your mastery of the language.\n\n**Types of Conjunctions:**\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions:** These are the most common and include 'for,' 'and,' 'nor,' 'but,' 'or,' 'yet,' and 'so' (FANBOYS). They connect words or independent clauses.\n\n   *Example:* I wanted to go for a walk, **but** it started raining.\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce dependent clauses and show the relationship between the dependent clause and the main clause.\n\n   *Examples:* because, although, since, unless, while, after, before.\n\n   *Example:* She stayed home **because** she was feeling sick.\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions:** These work in pairs to join equal elements.\n\n   *Examples:* both...and, either...or, neither...nor, not only...but also.\n\n   *Example:* **Both** the teacher **and** the students enjoyed the lesson.\n\n**Tips for Using Conjunctions:**\n- Place coordinating conjunctions between the words or clauses they join.\n- Use subordinating conjunctions at the beginning of dependent clauses.\n- Ensure correlative conjunctions are used in pairs and parallel in structure.\n\nBy mastering these conjunctions, you'll be able to craft sentences that are clear, varied, and engaging in American English.\n\nRemember, conjunctions are the glue of language—they help your thoughts stick together seamlessly!",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, conjunctions are often used in casual speech, emphasizing clarity and flow. Informal conversations frequently rely on coordinating conjunctions to link ideas quickly, such as 'but,' 'and,' and 'or.' Understanding how conjunctions work in American English can help learners sound more natural and connect ideas more effectively, whether in everyday conversations, business communications, or creative writing.",
