  "content": "In American English, articles are small words that help specify whether a noun is general or particular. There are two types: indefinite ('a' and 'an') and definite ('the').\n\n1. **Indefinite Articles ('a' and 'an')**:\n- Use 'a' before words that begin with a consonant sound: a dog, a university.\n- Use 'an' before words that begin with a vowel sound: an apple, an hour.\n- These articles refer to a non-specific item, meaning the listener or reader does not know exactly which one.\n\n2. **Definite Article ('the')**:\n- Use 'the' when referring to a specific item known to the speaker and listener.\n- It can be used with singular or plural nouns: the car, the cars.\n- It is also used when the item has been previously mentioned or is common knowledge.\n\n**Examples:**\n- I saw a bird in the tree. (any bird, not specific)\n- The bird in the garden is singing. (a specific bird)\n- She wants an orange. (any orange)\n- Please close the door. (a specific door)\n\n**Common errors:**\n- Saying 'a' before a vowel sound instead of 'an' (e.g., 'a orange' instead of 'an orange').\n- Omitting 'the' before a specific noun when needed.\n- Using 'the' with non-specific nouns incorrectly.\n\nMastering articles requires attention to pronunciation, context, and specificity. Practice will turn you into a true GOD of American English articles!",
