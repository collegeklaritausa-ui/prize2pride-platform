  "content": "Welcome to the lesson on Passive Voice, a crucial component for mastering American English grammar. Passive voice shifts the focus from who is performing an action to the action itself or its recipient. It is especially useful in formal writing, journalism, and situations where the agent is unknown or irrelevant.\n\n**Structure of Passive Voice:**\n- Subject + form of 'to be' + past participle + (optional 'by' + agent)\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The chef cooked the meal.\n- Passive: The meal was cooked by the chef.\n\n**When to Use Passive Voice:**\n- When the doer is unknown or unimportant (e.g., The window was broken last night.)\n- To emphasize the action or recipient.\n- In formal or scientific writing.\n\n**Converting Active to Passive:**\n1. Make the object of the active sentence the subject.\n2. Use the correct form of 'to be' matching the tense.\n3. Use the past participle of the main verb.\n4. Add 'by' + the original subject if necessary.\n\n**Example Conversion:**\n- Active: The team will complete the project.\n- Passive: The project will be completed by the team.\n\nPractice helps in mastering passive constructions. Remember, overuse can make writing dull or indirect; use it judiciously for clarity and emphasis.\n\nCongratulations on taking a step toward becoming a GOD of American English grammar!",

For example, 'The bridge was constructed in 2020.' Mastering passive voice enables you to understand and produce professional, polished communication typical in American journalism, business, and academia.",
