  "content": "Conjunctions are essential tools that help you create complex, coherent sentences in American English. Understanding the different types of conjunctions enables you to express relationships clearly and effectively.\n\n**1. Coordinating Conjunctions:**\nThese are the most common conjunctions, used to connect words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance.\n- Examples:\n  - She wanted to dance, **but** she was feeling tired.\n  - You can have tea **or** coffee.\n\n**2. Subordinating Conjunctions:**\nThese introduce dependent clauses, providing reasons, contrasts, conditions, or time relationships.\n- Examples:\n  - **Because** it was raining, we stayed indoors.\n  - I will call you **when** I arrive.\n\n**3. Correlative Conjunctions:**\nThese work in pairs to join equal parts of a sentence, emphasizing the choice or connection.\n- Examples:\n  - **Either** you apologize **or** you leave.\n  - She is **not only** talented **but also** hardworking.\n\n**Usage tips:**\n- Place coordinating conjunctions between the words or clauses they connect.\n- Use subordinating conjunctions at the beginning of dependent clauses.\n- Ensure correlative conjunctions are paired correctly and the sentence parts they connect are parallel.\n\n**Common mistakes to avoid:**\n- Omitting the comma before a coordinating conjunction when joining two independent clauses.\n- Misplacing subordinating conjunctions, which can change the meaning of a sentence.\n- Forgetting to use both parts of a correlative pair, leading to incomplete comparisons or lists.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, conjunctions are vital for expressing nuanced ideas and relationships in both casual conversations and formal writing. Americans value clarity and directness, so mastering conjunctions helps speakers and writers communicate effectively. For example, in everyday speech, conjunctions like 'but' and 'so' are frequently used to convey contrast and results, reflecting the straightforward communication style typical of American English speakers.",
