  "content": "Welcome to the world of passive voice! In American English, the passive voice is used to emphasize the action or the recipient of the action, rather than who performs it. The structure typically involves the verb 'to be' in the correct tense, followed by the past participle of the main verb.\n\n**Active voice example:**\n- The chef cooks the meal.\n\n**Passive voice example:**\n- The meal is cooked by the chef.\n\nNotice how the focus shifts from 'the chef' (the doer) to 'the meal' (the recipient). To form the passive voice:\n1. Identify the object of the active sentence.\n2. Use the correct form of 'to be' based on the tense.\n3. Use the past participle of the main verb.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Present: The students read the books. → The books are read by the students.\n- Past: The workers built the house. → The house was built by the workers.\n\n**When to use passive voice:**\n- When the doer is unknown or unimportant.\n- To emphasize the action or the recipient.\n- In formal writing.\n\nPractice converting sentences from active to passive to master this skill and become a true GOD of American English!",
