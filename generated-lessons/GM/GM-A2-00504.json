  "content": "Welcome to the world of conjunctions! Conjunctions are small words that connect parts of sentences, making your speech and writing clearer and more interesting. In American English, the most common conjunctions are 'and,' 'but,' and 'or.'\n\nFor example:\n- I want to go to the park **and** play soccer.\n- She is tired **but** happy.\n- Do you want tea **or** coffee?\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly helps you combine simple ideas into more complete and smooth sentences. Remember:\n- Use **and** to add information.\n- Use **but** to show contrast or difference.\n- Use **or** to give options.\n\nLet’s practice with some sentences to see how conjunctions work:\n- I like apples __ oranges.\n- She is smart __ she is shy.\n- Would you like water __ juice?\n\nBy mastering conjunctions, you'll be able to express your thoughts clearly and connect ideas seamlessly in American English!",
