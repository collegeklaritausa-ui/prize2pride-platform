  "content": "Welcome to the world of articles in American English! Articles are small words that come before nouns to give us more information about them. There are two types: indefinite ('a' and 'an') and definite ('the'). Use 'a' before words that start with a consonant sound and mean any one of something, like 'a cat.' Use 'an' before words that start with a vowel sound, like 'an elephant.' The definite article 'the' refers to a specific item known to both speaker and listener, such as 'the car.'\n\nExamples:\n- I saw a dog in the park.\n- She wants an orange.\n- Please open the door.\n\nRemember, don't use an article when talking about things in general, like 'Water is essential.'\n\nPractice makes perfect! Using the correct articles helps you sound more natural and clear in American English.",
