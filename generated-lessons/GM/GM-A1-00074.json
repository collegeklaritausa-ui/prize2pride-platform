  "content": "Welcome to the world of conditionals! Conditionals help us talk about real or possible situations and their outcomes. There are mainly two types suitable for beginners:\n\n1. Zero Conditional:\n- Used to describe facts or things that are always true.\n- Structure: If + present simple, present simple.\n- Example: If you don’t water plants, they die.\n\n2. First Conditional:\n- Used to talk about real possibilities in the future.\n- Structure: If + present simple, will + base verb.\n- Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will cancel the picnic.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Try creating your own sentences using these structures. Remember, in zero conditionals, both parts use the present simple. In first conditionals, the second part uses 'will' plus the base verb.\n\nUnderstanding these will help you describe facts and future plans clearly in American English. Now, go ahead and practice the examples below!",
