  "content": "Welcome to the lesson on Reported Speech! In American English, reported speech helps us tell others what someone else has said, without quoting them directly. It’s very useful in storytelling, conversations, and reporting news.\n\n**Direct Speech vs. Reported Speech:**\n- Direct: She said, \"I am tired.\"\n- Reported: She said she was tired.\n\n**Steps to Convert to Reported Speech:**\n1. Remove the quotation marks.\n2. Change the pronouns if needed.\n3. Shift the verb tense back (present to past, past to past perfect, etc.).\n4. Adjust time expressions if necessary.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: \"I will call you tomorrow,\" he said.\n- Reported: He said he would call me the next day.\n\n**Common Reporting Verbs:**\n- Said\n- Told\n- Asked\n- Mentioned\n- Explained\n\n**Note:** When using 'tell', always include the person being told: 'He told me...' or 'She told him...'.\n\n**Important Tense Changes:**\n- Present simple to past simple\n- Present continuous to past continuous\n- Will + verb to would + verb\n- Can to could\n\nPractice makes perfect! Use reported speech to share stories or relay conversations, making your American English sound natural and confident.",
