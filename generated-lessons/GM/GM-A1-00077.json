  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, conditionals are often used in casual conversations, especially when discussing plans or hypothetical situations. Americans frequently use contractions (e.g., I'll, she's, they'll), making speech sound natural and friendly. Understanding the use of conditionals helps you navigate social situations, express opinions, and discuss future plans with confidence, reflecting the direct and optimistic communication style common in the U.S.",
