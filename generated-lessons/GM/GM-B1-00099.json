  "content": "In American English, conditionals are essential for expressing possibilities, hypotheses, and results based on different situations. There are four main types:\n\n1. Zero Conditional – Used for universal truths and facts.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, + present simple\n   - Example: If you heat ice, it melts.\n\n2. First Conditional – Used for real future possibilities.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, + will + base verb\n   - Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will stay indoors.\n\n3. Second Conditional – Used for hypothetical or unlikely present or future situations.\n   - Structure: If + past simple, + would + base verb\n   - Example: If I won the lottery, I would buy a house.\n\n4. Third Conditional – Used for hypothetical past situations.\n   - Structure: If + past perfect, + would have + past participle\n   - Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the test.\n\nUnderstanding these conditionals allows you to express reality, possibility, and imagination effectively. Remember, in spoken American English, contractions are common, such as \"If it’s cold, I’ll wear a jacket.\" Also, pay attention to the use of 'were' in second conditionals for formal correctness and 'was' in casual speech.\n\nUsing conditionals confidently enhances your ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and convincingly in American English.",
