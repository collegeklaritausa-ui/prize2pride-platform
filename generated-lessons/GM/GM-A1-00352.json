  "content": "In American English, articles are small words that come before nouns to give us more information about the noun. There are two types of articles: definite and indefinite.\n\n1. **Indefinite Articles ('a' and 'an')**:\n- Use 'a' before words that start with a consonant sound. Example: a car, a dog, a university.\n- Use 'an' before words that start with a vowel sound. Example: an apple, an hour, an honest person.\n\n2. **Definite Article ('the')**:\n- Use 'the' when talking about a specific person, place, thing, or idea that both the speaker and listener know about. Example: The movie was fantastic.\n- Use 'the' when mentioning something for the second time or when the noun is unique. Example: I saw a bird. The bird was singing.\n\n**Examples in sentences:**\n- I saw **a** cat in the yard.\n- Please take **the** umbrella from the porch.\n- She is reading **an** interesting book.\n- **The** sun rises in the east.\n\n**Quick tips:**\n- Remember, 'a' and 'an' are for nonspecific items, while 'the' points to something specific.\n- Use 'an' before words starting with a vowel sound, not necessarily a vowel letter.\n- Practice by trying to add articles to nouns you use daily.\n\nBy mastering articles, you'll make your English sound more natural and clear, helping you become a true GOD of American English!",
