  "content": "To become a GOD of American English in reported speech, mastery of its intricate structures and contextual applications is essential. Begin by understanding that reported speech often involves transforming direct quotations into indirect form, which typically requires tense shifts, pronoun adjustments, and sometimes modal verb modifications.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n1. **Tense Backshift:** When reporting past statements, verbs generally shift one tense backward:\n   - Present simple → Past simple\n   - Present continuous → Past continuous\n   - Present perfect → Past perfect\n   - Will/Shall → Would\n\n2. **Pronoun and Time/Place Adjustments:** Change pronouns and time expressions to match the perspective of the reporter:\n   - \"I\" becomes \"he\" or \"she\"\n   - \"Today\" becomes \"that day\"\n   - \"Tomorrow\" becomes \"the next day\"\n\n3. **Question and Command Transformation:** Questions are introduced with 'ask' or 'wonder,' and commands with 'tell' or 'order.'\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: She said, \"I am tired.\" → Reported: She said that she was tired.\n- Direct: He asked, \"Are you coming?\" → Reported: He asked if I was coming.\n- Direct: John told me, \"Please close the door.\" → Reported: John asked me to close the door.\n\n**Advanced Tips:**\n- When the reporting verb is in the present or future tense, the tense shift may not be necessary.\n- For hypothetical or unreal situations, use 'could have,' 'would have,' etc.\n- Be aware of the context to determine whether to use 'say,' 'tell,' or other reporting verbs.\n\nMastering these transformations and understanding their nuances will elevate your command of American English to GOD-LEVEL excellence in reported speech.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, directness and clarity are highly valued, especially in professional and casual communication. When reporting speech, Americans often prefer precise and transparent transformations to maintain the original message's intent. Additionally, understanding idiomatic expressions and colloquial nuances in reported speech can significantly enhance authentic communication and cultural fluency. Mastery over reported speech also reflects a command of interpersonal nuances, such as showing politeness or conveying skepticism, which are essential in American social interactions.",
