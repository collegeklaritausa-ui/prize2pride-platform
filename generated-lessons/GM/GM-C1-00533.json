  "content": "Conjunctions are essential tools in American English, especially at an advanced level where sentence complexity and nuance are paramount. Understanding the different types of conjunctions allows you to craft sentences that are both clear and stylistically sophisticated.\n\n**1. Coordinating Conjunctions:** These connect words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance. Mastery of these enables smooth, compound sentences. For example:\n- \"She wanted to attend the concert, but she was too busy.\"\n\n**2. Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce subordinate clauses, establishing relationships such as cause, contrast, or time. They are crucial for creating complex sentences. For example:\n- \"Although he was tired, he finished his homework.\"\n- \"We will leave once the rain stops.\"\n\n**3. Correlative Conjunctions:** These work in pairs to join equal elements, adding emphasis and balance. For example:\n- \"Either you apologize, or I will be upset.\"\n- \"Neither the manager nor the employees knew about the changes.\"\n\n**4. Advanced Usage:** Combining conjunctions and varying sentence structures enhances your writing style. For example:\n- \"Not only did she prepare the presentation, but she also answered all questions confidently.\"\n\n**5. Punctuation and Style:** Proper placement of commas is vital, especially with complex sentences. Generally, place a comma before coordinating conjunctions when they join two independent clauses.\n\nBy mastering conjunctions, you elevate your ability to communicate nuanced ideas, draw logical connections, and create engaging, well-structured sentences that exemplify American English mastery.",
