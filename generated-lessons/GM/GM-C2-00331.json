  "content": "In American English, reported speech is essential for conveying conversations, stories, and information indirectly. Unlike direct quotes, reported speech summarizes or paraphrases what someone else has said, often using reporting verbs such as 'said,' 'told,' 'asked,' 'advised,' and more. When transforming direct speech into reported speech, tense shifts are common, especially if the reporting occurs after the original statement. For example:\n\nDirect: She said, 'I am tired.'\nReported: She said she **was** tired.\n\nKey rules include:\n1. Tense shifts: Present becomes past, past becomes past perfect, etc.\n2. Pronoun changes: 'I' becomes 'she,' 'we' becomes 'they,' etc.\n3. Time and place references may change: 'today' becomes 'that day,' 'here' becomes 'there.'\n4. Reporting verbs: Use appropriate verbs based on the context, e.g., 'asked' for questions, 'advised' for suggestions.\n\nExamples:\n- Direct: He said, 'I will call you later.'\n- Reported: He said he **would** call me later.\n\nRemember: In American English, it's common to omit quotation marks in indirect speech, so focus on clarity and correctness.\n\nBy mastering reported speech, you can confidently narrate conversations and improve your spoken and written communication skills in American English.",
