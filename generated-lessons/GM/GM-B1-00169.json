  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express ability, possibility, permission, obligation, or advice. They are used with the base form of the main verb and do not change form according to the subject.\n\nCommon modal verbs include can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would, and can’t.\n\nFor example:\n- Ability: I can swim.\n- Permission: May I leave early?\n- Obligation: You must wear a seatbelt.\n- Advice: You should study harder.\n- Hypothetical: I would buy a new car if I had more money.\n\nModal verbs often help convey the speaker’s attitude or the level of certainty about the action. They are essential for expressing politeness, making suggestions, giving commands, or speculating about possibilities.\n\nRemember: Modal verbs are followed by the base form of the main verb without 'to'. For example, 'She can dance' (not 'She can to dance').\n\nIn American culture, modal verbs are frequently used in everyday conversations, professional settings, and media, contributing to clear and respectful communication.",
