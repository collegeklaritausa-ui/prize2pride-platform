  "content": "The passive voice is an essential component of American English, used to shift focus from the subject performing an action to the action itself or its recipient. It is formed with the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' plus the past participle of the main verb. For example, in the present tense, 'The manager reviews the reports' becomes 'The reports are reviewed by the manager.' In the past tense, 'The team completed the project' becomes 'The project was completed by the team.' Using passive voice can emphasize the action or the recipient, create variety in sentence structure, or maintain focus on an object when the doer is unknown or irrelevant.\n\nHere's a breakdown of common passive voice constructions:\n- Present Simple: Subject + am/is/are + past participle\n  e.g., The mail is delivered daily.\n- Past Simple: Subject + was/were + past participle\n  e.g., The documents were signed yesterday.\n- Future Simple: Subject + will be + past participle\n  e.g., The packages will be shipped tomorrow.\n\nActive: The teacher grades the exams.\nPassive: The exams are graded by the teacher.\n\nNote that in formal or academic writing, passive voice is often preferred to focus on the process or results rather than the actor. However, overusing passive constructions can make writing less direct or lively.\n\nIn American media, passive voice is frequently used in news reports, scientific writing, and formal communications to maintain objectivity or focus on the event rather than the actor.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, passive voice is often used in formal writing, such as official reports, scientific articles, and news reports, to maintain objectivity and focus on actions rather than individuals. While it can sometimes create a sense of detachment, it also lends authority and professionalism to communication. Understanding how and when to use passive constructions helps students navigate both academic and professional American English contexts successfully.",
