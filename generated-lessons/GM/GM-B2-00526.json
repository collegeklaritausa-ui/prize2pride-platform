  "content": "Welcome to the realm of American English mastery: Conjunctions are the glue that binds your sentences, making your speech and writing more sophisticated and coherent. Mastery of conjunctions elevates your language from basic to impressive.\n\n**Types of Conjunctions:**\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS):** These connect words or phrases of equal importance.\n   - Example: I wanted to go for a walk, but it started raining.\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions:** These connect dependent clauses to independent clauses, adding details or reasons.\n   - Example: She stayed home because she was feeling sick.\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions:** These work in pairs to join equal sentence elements.\n   - Example: Neither the teacher nor the students knew about the surprise.\n\n**Usage Tips:**\n- When using coordinating conjunctions, remember to insert a comma before the conjunction if connecting two independent clauses.\n- Place subordinating conjunctions at the beginning of a dependent clause.\n- Use correlative conjunctions in pairs to balance your sentence structure.\n\n**Examples in Context:**\n- Coordinating: I wanted to buy the shirt, but it was too expensive.\n- Subordinating: Although the weather was bad, we decided to go hiking.\n- Correlative: Either you apologize, or I will be upset.\n\nBy mastering these conjunctions, you will craft sentences that flow smoothly and convincingly, making you a true GOD of American English!\n",
