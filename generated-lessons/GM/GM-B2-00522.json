  "content": "Mastering conjunctions is essential for achieving fluency and sophistication in American English. Conjunctions serve to connect ideas, making your speech and writing more coherent and dynamic.\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions:** These are the most common, linking words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance. Remember the FANBOYS acronym:\n   - For: Explains reason (e.g., I stayed inside, for it was raining.)\n   - And: Adds information (e.g., I like coffee and tea.)\n   - Nor: Presents a negative alternative (e.g., He doesn't like apples nor oranges.)\n   - But: Shows contrast (e.g., She is tall but shy.)\n   - Or: Presents an alternative (e.g., Would you like coffee or tea?)\n   - Yet: Introduces a contrasting idea (e.g., It's early, yet I'm tired.)\n   - So: Indicates effect or result (e.g., It was late, so I went home.)\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce dependent clauses and establish relationships such as cause, contrast, or condition.\n   - Examples:\n     - Because: I stayed home because it was cold.\n     - Although: Although he was tired, he kept working.\n     - If: We'll go outside if it stops raining.\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions:** These work in pairs to link equal elements, adding emphasis or balance.\n   - Examples:\n     - Either you leave now, or you'll miss the bus.\n     - Not only did she sing beautifully, but she also danced gracefully.\n\nUsing conjunctions effectively enhances your sentence structure, making your communication clear and engaging. Practice combining sentences with various conjunctions to elevate your mastery.\n",
