  "content": "Welcome, divine students, to the ultimate lesson on Passive Voice—your gateway to mastering a key pillar of American English grammar at a god-like level. The passive voice is not mere stylistic flourish; it is a powerful tool for emphasis, formality, and nuance.\n\n**Structure and Mechanics:**\n- The passive voice is formed with the appropriate *form of 'to be'* + the past participle of the main verb.\n- The tense of the original active sentence is preserved in the passive form:\n  - Present simple: *is/are* + past participle\n  - Past simple: *was/were* + past participle\n  - Present continuous: *is/are being* + past participle\n  - Present perfect: *has/have been* + past participle\n  - Future: *will be* + past participle\n\n**Active to Passive Conversion Rules:**\n1. Identify the object of the active sentence (becomes the new subject).\n2. Use the correct form of 'to be' matching the original tense.\n3. Add the past participle of the main verb.\n4. Optionally, include the original subject as the agent, preceded by 'by'.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The committee reviews the application.\n- Passive: The application is reviewed by the committee.\n\n- Active: The team had completed the project.\n- Passive: The project had been completed by the team.\n\n**Nuances and Stylistic Considerations:**\n- Use passive voice to emphasize the action or the recipient rather than the doer.\n- Employ agentless structures in situations where the agent is unknown, unimportant, or obvious.\n- Avoid overuse to prevent vagueness or diminish clarity.\n- In formal, academic, or diplomatic contexts, passive voice lends an air of objectivity and professionalism.\n\n**Elevating Your Language:**\n- Combine passive constructions with complex sentences for sophisticated expression.\n- Use impersonal passive to convey general truths or hypotheses.\n- Master the subtle art of when to employ passive voice for emphasis versus active voice for clarity.\n\nRemember, as a GOD of American English, your ability to wield passive voice with precision and style will set you apart in your command of language.\n\n**Practice Mindfully:**\nAnalyze your writing for passive structures, refine and transform sentences, and elevate your expression to divine mastery.",
