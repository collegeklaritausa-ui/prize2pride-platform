  "content": "Welcome to your American English journey! Today, we're learning about modal verbs—special words that help us talk about ability, permission, necessity, and future plans. Modal verbs are simple but powerful. For example, 'can' shows what you are able to do: 'I can swim.' When you're allowed to do something, you might say, 'May I go outside?' To express obligation, use 'must': 'You must wear your seatbelt.' For suggestions, try 'should': 'You should study more.' And to talk about the future, use 'will': 'I will visit my grandma.' Remember, modal verbs are always followed by the base form of a verb. For example, 'can' + 'dance' = 'can dance.' Practice using these modals in your daily conversations to become more confident!\n\nExample sentences:\n- I can help you.\n- She must finish her homework.\n- May I open the window?\n- You should drink water.\n- We will see a movie tonight.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, modal verbs often show respect and politeness, especially when making requests or asking for permission. Saying 'May I' is polite, while using 'Can I' is more casual but still acceptable in informal settings. Americans value clarity and directness, so learning to use modal verbs confidently helps you communicate effectively in everyday situations like asking for help, giving advice, or making plans.",
