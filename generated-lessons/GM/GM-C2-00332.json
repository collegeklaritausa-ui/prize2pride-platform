  "content": "Welcome to mastery of Reported Speech, the essential skill to sound fluent and natural in American English. When we report what someone else has said, we often need to change the original words for clarity, perspective, and grammatical correctness.\n\n**Key Rules:**\n1. **Tense Shift:** Typically, the tense of the verb in direct speech shifts back in reported speech. For example:\n- Present simple → Past simple\n- Present continuous → Past continuous\n- Present perfect → Past perfect\n- Will → Would\n\n2. **Pronoun Adjustment:** Change pronouns to match the reporting context.\n- \"I\" becomes \"he\" or \"she\"\n- \"You\" becomes \"I\" or \"we\"\n\n3. **Time and Place Expressions:** Adjust these to fit the reporting context.\n- \"Today\" → \"that day\"\n- \"Tomorrow\" → \"the next day\"\n- \"Here\" → \"there\"\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: She said, \"I am going to the store.\"\n- Reported: She said she **was** going to the store.\n\n- Direct: He asked, \"Are you coming to the party?\"\n- Reported: He asked if I **was** coming to the party.\n\n**Using Reporting Verbs:**\n- Common verbs include: 'say', 'tell', 'ask', 'explain', 'advise', 'suggest'.\n- Example: She **told** me she was tired.\n\n**Advanced Tips:**\n- When reporting questions, change the question form into a statement, often using 'if' or 'whether' for yes/no questions.\n- Be mindful of the tone and context to choose the most appropriate reporting verb.\n\nBy mastering these rules and practicing with real-life examples, you'll elevate your American English to GOD-level fluency in reported speech!",
