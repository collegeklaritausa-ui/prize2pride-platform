  "content": "In American English, sentence structure is essential for clear and effective communication. A well-structured sentence helps your ideas flow logically and makes your speech or writing more professional.\n\n**Components of a Sentence:**\nEvery complete sentence must have at least one subject and one predicate. The subject tells who or what the sentence is about, while the predicate explains what the subject does or is.\n\n**Types of Sentences:**\n- *Simple Sentence:* Contains a single independent clause. Example: \"The dog barked.\"\n- *Compound Sentence:* Combines two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so). Example: \"I wanted coffee, but the shop was closed.\"\n- *Complex Sentence:* Contains an independent clause and at least one dependent clause, introduced by subordinating conjunctions (because, although, since, if). Example: \"She stayed home because she was sick.\"\n\n**Common Sentence Errors:**\n- *Run-on sentences:* These occur when two or more independent clauses are joined without correct punctuation or conjunctions. Fix them by using a semicolon, period, or coordinating conjunction.\n- *Comma splices:* When two independent clauses are joined by a comma alone. Correct by adding a coordinating conjunction or separating into two sentences.\n\n**Tips for Mastery:**\n- Practice combining sentences using different structures.\n- Break down complex sentences to understand their components.\n- Proofread your writing to spot and correct run-ons and comma splices.\n\n**Example:**\nIncorrect: \"She loves to dance she goes to classes every week.\"\nCorrected: \"She loves to dance, and she goes to classes every week.\"\n\nBy mastering sentence structure, you will communicate more effectively and confidently in your American English journey!",
