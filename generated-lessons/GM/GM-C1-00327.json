  "content": "To achieve mastery in reported speech, it's essential to understand its complex structures and subtle nuances. In advanced contexts, reported speech often involves shifts in tense, mood, and modality, requiring precise grammatical adjustments.\n\n**Tense Backshift:** When reporting past statements, verbs typically shift backward in tense:\n- Present simple to past simple (e.g., 'I like' → 'he said he liked')\n- Present continuous to past continuous ('I am working' → 'she said she was working')\n- Present perfect to past perfect ('I have seen' → 'he said he had seen')\n\n**Modality and Modal Verbs:** Modal verbs change to their past forms:\n- 'can' becomes 'could'\n- 'will' becomes 'would'\n- 'may' becomes 'might'\n\n**Reporting Verbs:** The choice of reporting verb influences tone and meaning. For example:\n- 'claimed' vs. 'admitted' vs. 'denied' reflect different attitudes.\n- Use 'suggested' or 'advised' when offering recommendations.\n\n**Complex Sentences and Mixed Tenses:** Be cautious of mixed tenses that can confuse the listener or reader. Keep track of original timing and context.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: \"I am planning to visit New York next week,\" she said.\n- Reported: She said she was planning to visit New York the following week.\n\n- Direct: \"We have completed the project,\" the manager announced.\n- Reported: The manager announced that they had completed the project.\n\nPracticing these transformations in varied contexts will solidify your command over reported speech, making your American English more polished and authoritative.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American English, reported speech is often used in informal contexts like conversations, interviews, and media reporting. Americans value clarity and directness, so choosing appropriate reporting verbs and avoiding ambiguity are highly appreciated. Additionally, when conveying reports of events, Americans often adapt the tense and details to fit the current context or timeframe, which is crucial for maintaining relevance and immediacy in communication.",
