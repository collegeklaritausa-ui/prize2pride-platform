  "content": "Welcome to your journey towards becoming a GOD of American English! Today, we'll focus on the simple present tense, the foundation for talking about routines, facts, and general truths.\n\nThe simple present tense is formed using the base form of the verb for most subjects. For third person singular (he, she, it), add an -s or -es to the verb.\n\nExamples:\n- I/You/We/They **work** at the store.\n- He/She/It **works** at the store.\n\nUse the simple present tense when:\n- Talking about routines: \"I wake up at 7 am.\"\n- Stating facts: \"The sun rises in the east.\"\n- Describing habits: \"They play soccer on weekends.\"\n\nLet's look at some sentence structures:\n- Affirmative: Subject + base verb (+s/es for third person singular)\n- Negative: Subject + do/does not + base verb\n- Question: Do/Does + subject + base verb?\n\nExamples:\n- Affirmative: She **likes** chocolate.\n- Negative: They **do not** like rain.\n- Question: **Does** he work here?\n\nRemember, always match the verb form with the subject for correct grammar!\n\nNow, practice by transforming these statements into questions or negatives using the simple present tense.",
