  "content": "Welcome to your lesson on conditionals! Conditionals are sentences that express situations that depend on something else happening. There are three main types of conditionals:\n\n1. Zero Conditional: Used for general truths and facts.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, + present simple\n   - Example: If you heat water to 100°C, it boils.\n\n2. First Conditional: Used for real future possibilities.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, + will + base verb\n   - Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will cancel the picnic.\n\n3. Second Conditional: Used for hypothetical or unlikely situations in the present or future.\n   - Structure: If + past simple, + would + base verb\n   - Example: If I had a million dollars, I would buy a house.\n\nLet's look at some examples:\n- Zero: If you mix red and blue, you get purple.\n- First: If I see Sarah, I will tell her about the meeting.\n- Second: If I were a bird, I would fly across the country.\n\nRemember, mastering conditionals helps you talk about facts, plans, and imaginary situations confidently. Practice forming these sentences and you'll become a true GOD of American English!\n",
