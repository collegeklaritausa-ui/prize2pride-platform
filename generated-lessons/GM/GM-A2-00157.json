  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are essential tools to express ability, permission, possibility, necessity, and obligation. They are used with the base form of the main verb.\n\nCommon modal verbs include:\n- Can (ability, permission)\n- Could (past ability, polite permission)\n- May (permission, possibility)\n- Might (possibility)\n- Must (necessity, obligation)\n- Shall (formal suggestions, questions)\n- Should (advice, recommendation)\n- Will (future intentions)\n- Would (polite requests, hypothetical situations)\n\nExamples:\n- I can ride a bike.\n- May I use your pen?\n- You must wear a seatbelt.\n- She should study more.\n- Will you come to the party?\n\nRemember:\n- Use \"can\" for ability and permission.\n- \"May\" and \"might\" indicate possibility.\n- \"Must\" shows obligation.\n- Use \"should\" for advice.\n- \"Will\" expresses future actions.\n\nQuestions and negatives are formed by placing 'do/does/did' before the modal verb or adding 'not' after the modal:\n- Can you help me?\n- She cannot (can't) attend.\n- Must I leave now?\n- You should not (shouldn't) forget.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Use modal verbs daily to become a true GOD of American English.",

Understanding how to use modal verbs appropriately can help students navigate social interactions in the U.S., from asking for help to giving advice politely.",
