  "content": "Welcome, future gods of American English! Today, we'll explore the passive voice, a useful way to focus on the action or the recipient of an action. In active voice, you say who does something: 'The dog chased the ball.' In passive voice, you focus on what is done or to whom: 'The ball was chased by the dog.' \n\nPassive voice is formed with the correct form of the verb 'to be' plus the past participle of the main verb. For example:\n- Present tense: 'The letter is written by the student.'\n- Past tense: 'The house was built by workers.'\n\nUse the passive voice when the doer is unknown, unimportant, or obvious. For instance:\n- 'The cake was eaten.' (We don't know who ate it.)\n- 'The bills are paid every month.'\n\nLet's look at some examples:\n- Active: 'The teacher explains the lesson.'\n- Passive: 'The lesson is explained by the teacher.'\n\nRemember, mastering passive voice adds flexibility and variety to your sentences, making you a true GOD of American English!\n\nNow, let's practice transforming sentences from active to passive voice and vice versa to cement your knowledge.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, the passive voice is often used in formal writing, news reports, and when the focus is on the action or event rather than the performer. Understanding when to use active or passive voice can help you sound more natural and professional. Americans value clarity and directness, so mastering both voices allows you to communicate effectively in various contexts, from casual conversations to formal writing.",
