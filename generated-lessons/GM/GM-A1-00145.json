  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are special auxiliary verbs that help us express different ideas like ability, permission, necessity, or possibility. Unlike regular verbs, modal verbs do not change form for different subjects or tenses. They are followed directly by the base form of the main verb.\n\nCommon modal verbs include can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, and would.\n\nFor example:\n- Ability: \"She can drive.\" (She has the ability to drive.)\n- Permission: \"May I come in?\" (Asking for permission.)\n- Necessity: \"You must wear a seatbelt.\" (It’s necessary to wear a seatbelt.)\n- Future: \"I will help you.\" (Promise or intention to help.)\n\nRemember, modal verbs help make your sentences clearer about what you're able to do, allowed to do, or plan to do. Practice using them in conversation to become more confident in American English!\n",
