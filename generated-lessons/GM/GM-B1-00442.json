  "content": "Prepositions are small but mighty words that establish relationships between different elements in a sentence. They are essential for clarity and precision in communication. In American English, prepositions like 'in,' 'on,' 'at,' 'by,' 'with,' 'about,' and 'for' are frequently used.\n\nPrepositions of place answer questions like 'where?' Example: 'The keys are in the drawer.' Here, 'in' shows location.\n\nPrepositions of time specify when something happens. Example: 'The meeting is at 3 PM.'\n\nPrepositions of movement describe direction or motion. Example: 'She walked to the park.'\n\nRemember, prepositions are usually followed by their object, which can be a noun or pronoun. Correct placement is crucial: typically, the preposition comes before its object.\n\nCommon mistakes include ending sentences with prepositions or misusing prepositions in idiomatic expressions. For example, instead of saying 'Where are you at?', say 'Where are you?' or 'Where are you at?'\n\nPracticing with real-life sentences helps reinforce correct usage and builds confidence in mastering prepositions.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, prepositions often reflect casual speech patterns. For example, Americans frequently use 'on' for public transportation: 'I’m on the bus.' Additionally, idiomatic expressions, such as 'in charge of,' 'at a loss,' or 'by the way,' are common and enrich communication. Understanding these nuances helps non-native speakers sound more natural and integrated into American social contexts.",
