  "content": "Conjunctions are the connective tissue of language, allowing us to craft intricate, precise, and elegant expressions. Mastering their use elevates your command of American English, enabling nuanced communication.\n\n**Types of Conjunctions:**\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions:** These link equal elements—words, phrases, or independent clauses. They are the backbone of compound sentences.\n\n   - Example: \"She wanted to go for a walk, but it started raining.\"\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce dependent clauses, providing context, cause, contrast, or condition.\n\n   - Example: \"Although he was tired, he continued working.\"\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions:** These work in pairs to join equivalent elements for emphasis or balance.\n\n   - Example: \"Neither the manager nor the employees were prepared for the audit.\"\n\n**Advanced Usage Tips:**\n- Use subordinating conjunctions to craft complex sentences that show relationships like cause and effect, contrast, or concession.\n- Incorporate correlative conjunctions for emphasis and parallelism, adding rhythm and balance to your sentences.\n- Be cautious of misplaced conjunctions, which can lead to run-on sentences or ambiguity.\n- In formal writing, favor clear and precise conjunctions to maintain professionalism.\n\n**Examples in Context:**\n- \"Despite the forecast predicting rain, the event proceeded as scheduled.\"\n- \"Not only did she excel in academics, but she also demonstrated outstanding leadership skills.\"\n- \"Because he lacked experience, he was given extra training to ensure success.\"\n\nHarnessing conjunctions with mastery empowers you to articulate complex ideas succinctly and elegantly, transforming your language into a true art form.",
