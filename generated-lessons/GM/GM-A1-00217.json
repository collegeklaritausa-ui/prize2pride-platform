  "content": "Welcome to your lesson on the passive voice! In American English, understanding the passive voice helps you sound more natural and versatile. \n\nThe passive voice is formed using a form of the verb 'to be' + the past participle of the main verb. For example: 'The letter was sent by John.' This emphasizes the action or the object receiving the action, rather than who is performing it.\n\nIn contrast, the active voice focuses on the subject performing the action. For example: 'John sent the letter.'\n\n**When to use the passive voice:**\n- When the doer of the action is unknown or unimportant.\n- To emphasize the action or the recipient.\n- In formal or scientific writing.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The chef cooked a delicious meal.\n- Passive: A delicious meal was cooked by the chef.\n\nTransforming sentences:\n- Active: The kids cleaned the park.\n- Passive: The park was cleaned by the kids.\n\nRemember, in casual American conversations, active voice is more common, but the passive voice is useful especially in formal contexts, news reports, or when the focus is on the action itself.\n\nLet's practice turning active sentences into passive ones and vice versa to master this skill!",

  "culturalNotes": "In American English, the passive voice is often used in formal writing, news reports, and academic contexts. Americans value clarity and directness, so while the passive voice has its place, active voice is typically preferred in everyday conversations. Understanding when and how to use the passive voice enhances your ability to communicate effectively in various American settings, from business meetings to casual talks.",
