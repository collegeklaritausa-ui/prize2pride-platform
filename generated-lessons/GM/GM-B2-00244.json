  "content": "The passive voice is a powerful tool in American English that shifts focus from the subject performing an action to the recipient of that action. It is especially useful when the doer is unknown, irrelevant, or implied.\n\n**Formation of Passive Voice:**\n- Use the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' based on the tense.\n- Add the past participle of the main verb.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The company will launch the new product.\n- Passive: The new product will be launched by the company.\n\n**Transforming sentences:**\n- Active: The chef cooked a delicious meal.\n- Passive: A delicious meal was cooked by the chef.\n\n**Passive voice in different tenses:**\n- Present: The emails are sent daily.\n- Past: The report was finished yesterday.\n- Future: The package will be delivered tomorrow.\n\n**Using passive voice effectively:**\n- Use when the doer is unknown or unimportant.\n- Avoid overusing passive voice to keep your writing clear and direct.\n- Incorporate passive voice in formal writing, such as reports and official documents.\n\n**Active vs. Passive:**\n- Active: The students completed the assignment.\n- Passive: The assignment was completed by the students.\n\nUnderstanding when and how to use passive voice will elevate your command of American English, making your speech and writing more nuanced and professional.",

For example, scientific reports and official documents frequently utilize passive constructions to focus on procedures and results rather than on individuals.
