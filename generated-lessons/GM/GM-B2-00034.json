Past Tenses:\n   - Simple Past (e.g., I worked)\n   - Past Continuous (e.g., I was working)\n   - Past Perfect (e.g., I had worked)\n   - Past Perfect Continuous (e.g., I had been working)\n\n3. Future Tenses:\n   - Simple Future (e.g., I will work)\n   - Future Continuous (e.g., I will be working)\n   - Future Perfect (e.g., I will have worked)\n   - Future Perfect Continuous (e.g., I will have been working)\n\nTo become a GOD of American English, focus on understanding the purpose and formation of each tense:\n- The simple tenses describe general truths or habitual actions.\n- Continuous tenses highlight ongoing actions.\n- Perfect tenses relate actions to specific points in time, emphasizing completion.\n- Perfect continuous tenses stress the duration of actions.\n\nExample Sentences:\n- Present Simple: \"She writes emails every day.\"\n- Present Continuous: \"She is writing an email now.\"\n- Past Perfect: \"She had written the report before the meeting.\"\n- Future Perfect: \"She will have finished the project by next week.\"\n\nMastery involves not just formation but also understanding contextual appropriateness, common errors (like confusing present perfect with simple past), and idiomatic usage. Practice by creating sentences in different tenses and analyzing their time reference and aspect.\"",
