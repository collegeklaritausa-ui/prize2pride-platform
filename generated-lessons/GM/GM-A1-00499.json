  "content": "Welcome to your journey to mastering conjunctions in American English! Conjunctions are essential tools that help you connect ideas, making your speech and writing more fluent and natural.\n\nThere are two main types of conjunctions:\n\n1. *Coordinating Conjunctions:* These include *and*, *but*, *or*, *nor*, *for*, *yet*, and *so*. They connect words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance.\n\n   - Example: \"She likes tea *and* coffee.\"\n\n2. *Subordinating Conjunctions:* These include *because*, *although*, *since*, *unless*, *while*, and *after*. They introduce dependent clauses that provide additional information.\n\n   - Example: \"I went to bed early *because* I was tired.\"\n\nUsing conjunctions correctly makes your communication clearer and more engaging. For instance, instead of saying, \"I like swimming. I like biking,\" you can say, \"I like swimming *and* biking.\"\n\nPractice makes perfect! Try to think of two ideas and connect them using the appropriate conjunction. Remember, choosing the right conjunction helps your message flow smoothly.\n\nNow, let's see some examples:\n\n- I wanted to go outside, *but* it started raining.\n- She studies hard, *so* she passes her exams.\n- We can watch a movie, *or* we can go for a walk.\n- *Although* it was cold, we went hiking.\n- He didn't attend the party *because* he was feeling sick.",
