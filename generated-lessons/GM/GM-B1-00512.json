  "content": "Conjunctions are essential tools in American English that help create clear, cohesive, and complex sentences. There are three main types:\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions**: These connect words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance. They are often remembered by the acronym FANBOYS:\n   - **For** (reason)\n   - **And** (addition)\n   - **Nor** (negative choice)\n   - **But** (contrast)\n   - **Or** (choice)\n   - **Yet** (contrast)\n   - **So** (result)\n\n   *Example*: I wanted to go for a walk, **but** it was raining.\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions**: These introduce dependent clauses and show the relationship between the dependent clause and the main clause.\n\n   *Examples*: because, although, since, if, when, while, unless\n\n   *Example*: **Because** it was raining, we stayed indoors.\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions**: These work in pairs to connect equal parts of a sentence.\n\n   *Examples*: either...or, neither...nor, both...and, not only...but also\n\n   *Example*: **Both** my brother **and** my sister are coming to the party.\n\n**Tips for mastering conjunctions:**\n- Use conjunctions to avoid choppy sentences and improve flow.\n- Pay attention to punctuation; most independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction need a comma.\n- Be cautious with dangling or misplaced conjunctions that can cause confusion.\n- Practice combining sentences to enhance your writing skills.\n\nIn American culture, fluent use of conjunctions is valued in both casual conversations and formal writing, as it demonstrates clarity and logical connection in your communication.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American English, the use of conjunctions reflects a preference for clarity and fluidity in speech and writing. Americans value well-connected ideas, especially in academic and professional contexts where coherence is essential. Mastery of conjunctions can also influence how persuasive and logical your communication appears, which is highly regarded in American culture. Additionally, the American style often favors simple and straightforward sentence structures, making the effective use of conjunctions a key skill for learners aiming for fluency and sophistication.",
