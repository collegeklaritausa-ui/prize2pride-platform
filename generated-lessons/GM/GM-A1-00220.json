  "content": "Welcome to the world of American English! Today, we focus on the passive voice, a way to emphasize the action or the recipient of an action rather than the doer. In active voice, the subject performs the action: 'The teacher grades the exams.' In passive voice, the focus shifts: 'The exams are graded by the teacher.' The structure typically follows: subject + be verb + past participle (+ by + doer). For example:\n\n- Active: The chef cooked the meal.\n- Passive: The meal was cooked by the chef.\n\nPassive voice is often used in formal writing, news reports, or when the doer is unknown or unimportant. Remember, the key is matching the correct form of 'be' with the past participle of the main verb, based on tense. For beginners, focus on simple present and simple past tenses.\n\nExamples:\n- Present: The packages are delivered daily.\n- Past: The letter was sent yesterday.\n\nPractice converting active sentences to passive voice to become comfortable with this structure. For example, change 'The children played soccer' to 'Soccer was played by the children.' Keep practicing to master this powerful grammatical tool!",
