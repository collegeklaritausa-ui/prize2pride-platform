  "content": "In American English, articles are small words that help us specify nouns. There are three articles: 'a,' 'an,' and 'the.' \n\n1. The indefinite articles 'a' and 'an' are used when talking about something for the first time or something unspecific. \n- Use 'a' before words that begin with a consonant sound: a dog, a car, a university.\n- Use 'an' before words that begin with a vowel sound: an apple, an hour, an elephant.\n\n2. The definite article 'the' is used when talking about something specific or already known to the listener. \n- Example: I saw the dog you mentioned.\n\n3. Remember, the choice between 'a' and 'an' depends on the sound, not necessarily the letter. For instance, 'honor' starts with a silent 'h,' so you say 'an honor.' \n\nLet's see some examples:\n- I saw a bird in the park.\n- Can you pass me an orange?\n- The sun is shining today.\n\nPracticing these rules will help your speech and writing sound natural and clear!",
