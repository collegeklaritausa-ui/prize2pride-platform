  "content": "Achieving GOD-LEVEL mastery in reported speech requires a deep understanding of its mechanics in American English. When transforming direct statements into reported speech, pay close attention to tense shifts: present becomes past, present perfect becomes past perfect, and so forth. For example, 'I am tired' becomes 'He said he was tired.'\n\nReporting verbs add nuance—'say' and 'tell' are most common, but verbs like 'advise,' 'explain,' and 'suggest' can convey specific meanings. Remember that 'tell' typically requires an indirect object (e.g., 'She told me...'), whereas 'say' does not.\n\nQuestions and commands also transform uniquely. Yes/no questions change from 'Are you coming?' to 'He asked if I was coming.' Wh-questions such as 'Where are you going?' become 'He asked where I was going.' Commands or imperatives turn into reported speech with 'told' or 'asked,' e.g., 'Close the door' → 'He told me to close the door.'\n\nMastering these transformations empowers you to communicate with nuance, clarity, and cultural authenticity, elevating your American English proficiency to GOD-LEVEL.",

When reporting speech, Americans often prefer straightforward translations that reflect the original tone and intent. Using appropriate reporting verbs and tense shifts demonstrates cultural awareness and linguistic mastery. Additionally, understanding the context—whether formal or informal—is key in choosing the right structure, embodying the American value of clarity and transparency in communication.",
