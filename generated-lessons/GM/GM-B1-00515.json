  "content": "Conjunctions are essential tools in American English that help connect ideas smoothly, making your speech and writing more coherent and persuasive. There are three main types: \n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions**: These include 'for,' 'and,' 'nor,' 'but,' 'or,' 'yet,' and 'so' (FANBOYS). They link words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance.\n\n   - *Example:* I wanted to buy a new jacket, but it was too expensive.\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions**: These introduce subordinate clauses and show the relationship between the clause and the rest of the sentence. Common subordinators include 'because,' 'although,' 'since,' 'if,' 'when,' and 'while.'\n\n   - *Example:* She didn’t go to the party because she was feeling sick.\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions**: These come in pairs and work together to connect equal parts of a sentence.\n\n   - *Examples:* Either you apologize, or the problem will worsen.\n\n**Tips for Mastery:**\n- Place coordinating conjunctions between two independent clauses.\n- Use subordinating conjunctions to show cause, contrast, or time relationships.\n- Pair correlative conjunctions correctly to maintain sentence balance.\n\nPracticing the correct placement and usage of conjunctions will elevate your clarity and elegance in American English.\n\nRemember, mastering conjunctions empowers you to craft complex and compelling sentences like a true GOD of American English!",
