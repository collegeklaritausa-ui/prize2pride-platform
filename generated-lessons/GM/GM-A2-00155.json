  "content": "Welcome to your journey to becoming a GOD of American English! Today, we focus on modal verbs—small words that carry big meaning. Modal verbs include can, must, may, should, and will. They help us express ability, permission, obligation, possibility, and future actions.\n\nFor example:\n- Ability: I can swim.\n- Permission: May I leave early?\n- Obligation: You must finish your homework.\n- Advice: You should see a doctor.\n- Future: I will visit my friend tomorrow.\n\nRemember, modal verbs are always followed by the base form of the main verb (no ‘to’). For example: can go, must study.\n\nPractice speaking and writing these sentences using different modal verbs to become more confident. The more you practice, the more you master these essential words—and become a true GOD of American English!",
