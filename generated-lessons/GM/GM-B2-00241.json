  "content": "The passive voice is an essential aspect of American English grammar, allowing speakers and writers to emphasize the action or the recipient of the action rather than the doer. Active sentences follow the structure: Subject + Verb + Object (e.g., 'The chef cooked the meal.'), whereas passive sentences invert this structure to: Object + form of 'to be' + past participle + (by + Agent). For example, 'The meal was cooked by the chef.' \n\nUnderstanding when and how to use the passive voice enhances your ability to write more formally, vary sentence structure, and focus on different parts of a message. In American English, the passive voice is commonly used in news reports, scientific writing, and formal documentation, but overuse can make writing seem dull or impersonal.\n\nHere's how to transform active sentences into passive:\n1. Identify the object of the active sentence.\n2. Make that object the subject of the passive sentence.\n3. Use the appropriate form of 'to be' based on the tense.\n4. Add the past participle of the main verb.\n5. Optionally, include the agent introduced by 'by'.\n\nExamples:\n- Active: The company will launch the new product.\n- Passive: The new product will be launched by the company.\n\nPractice transforming sentences to master this skill and become a true GOD of American English grammar mastery.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American journalism and formal writing, passive voice is often used to focus on actions and outcomes rather than actors, for example in scientific reports or official statements. However, in everyday conversation, Americans tend to prefer active voice for clarity and directness. Balancing the use of passive voice with active constructions is key to sounding natural and professional in American English.",
