  "content": "Conjunctions are the linguistic glue that hold your sentences together, enabling clear and sophisticated expression in American English. Recognizing the different types of conjunctions allows you to craft sentences that are not only correct but also stylistically powerful.\n\n**1. Coordinating Conjunctions:** These are the simplest and most common, connecting words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance.\n- Example: \"I wanted to attend the concert, but I was too tired.\"\n- Tip: Use FANBOYS (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) as a mnemonic to recall coordinating conjunctions.\n\n**2. Subordinating Conjunctions:** These connect a subordinate (dependent) clause to a main (independent) clause, adding information about time, cause, condition, or contrast.\n- Example: \"She stayed home because it was raining.\"\n- Tip: Common subordinating conjunctions include because, since, although, if, when.\n\n**3. Correlative Conjunctions:** These work in pairs to join two balanced elements, emphasizing the relationship between them.\n- Example: \"Either you apologize, or I will leave the room.\"\n- Tip: Always use the pairs together to maintain balance.\n\n**4. Sentence Structure and Conjunctions:** Using conjunctions correctly allows for varied sentence structures, such as compound or complex sentences, which enhance writing style and clarity.\n- Example of compound: \"I studied hard, and I passed the test.\"\n- Example of complex: \"Although I was tired, I continued working.\"\n\nMastering conjunctions empowers you to create nuanced, cohesive, and persuasive sentences that resonate with native speakers and demonstrate mastery of American English.\n",
