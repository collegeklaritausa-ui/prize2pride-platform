  "content": "The passive voice is a vital aspect of American English, especially useful for emphasizing the action or the recipient rather than the doer. Constructing the passive involves turning the object of an active sentence into the subject of the passive sentence, often using a form of 'to be' plus the past participle of the main verb.\n\nFor example, the active sentence: 'The chef cooked the meal.' can be transformed into the passive: 'The meal was cooked by the chef.' Here, 'the meal' becomes the subject, and 'was cooked' is the passive verb form.\n\n**Steps to form the passive voice:**\n1. Identify the object of the active sentence.\n2. Make that object the subject of the new sentence.\n3. Use the correct form of the verb 'to be' matching the tense of the original verb.\n4. Add the past participle of the main verb.\n5. Optionally, include the original subject preceded by 'by'.\n\n**Examples by tense:**\n- Present: 'The team completes the project.' → 'The project is completed by the team.'\n- Past: 'The company launched the product.' → 'The product was launched by the company.'\n- Future: 'The manager will review the report.' → 'The report will be reviewed by the manager.'\n\n**When to use passive voice:**\n- When the doer is unknown or unimportant.\n- To emphasize the action or the recipient.\n- In formal or scientific writing.\n\nMastering the passive voice enhances your ability to write more versatile, precise, and stylistically rich American English.",
