  "content": "Welcome to the world of reported speech, a vital aspect of American English that allows you to relay conversations, stories, and information indirectly. When transforming direct quotes into reported speech, the key is to adjust tense, pronouns, and time expressions appropriately.\n\n**Direct speech**: He said, \"I am going to the store.\"\n**Reported speech**: He said that he was going to the store.\n\n**Key rules:**\n- Tense Shift: Present becomes past, present perfect becomes past perfect, etc.\n- Pronoun Adjustment: Change 'I' to 'he' or 'she' based on the speaker.\n- Time and place expressions: 'Today' becomes 'that day', 'now' becomes 'then'.\n\n**Common reporting verbs** include: say, tell, ask, claim, explain, suggest.\n\n*Examples:* \n- She told me she was feeling sick.\n- He asked if I was coming to the party.\n- They claimed they had finished the work.\n\nPractice converting direct speech into reported speech to build mastery. Remember, mastering these skills will help you sound more natural and confident in both casual and formal American English conversations and writing.",
