  "content": "In American English, conditionals are essential for expressing possibilities, hypotheses, and consequences. There are four main types:\n\n1. Zero Conditional: Used for general truths or facts.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, ... present simple\n   - Example: If you heat ice, it melts.\n\n2. First Conditional: Used for real and possible future situations.\n   - Structure: If + present simple, ... will + base verb\n   - Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will cancel the picnic.\n\n3. Second Conditional: Used for hypothetical or unlikely present or future situations.\n   - Structure: If + past simple, ... would + base verb\n   - Example: If I won the lottery, I would buy a house.\n\n4. Third Conditional: Used for past situations that did not happen.\n   - Structure: If + past perfect, ... would have + past participle\n   - Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the test.\n\nNote: American English often uses contractions in speech and writing, such as 'if it's' instead of 'if it is'.\n\nUnderstanding these conditionals enables you to communicate complex ideas, express regrets, or describe possible scenarios with clarity and confidence in American English.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, conditionals often reflect optimism and practicality, especially in everyday conversations. Americans frequently use the first conditional to discuss plans and future possibilities, emphasizing proactive attitudes. Additionally, in informal speech, contractions and colloquial expressions are common, making conditionals sound natural and friendly. Understanding the use of conditionals can help you sound more fluent and culturally aware when engaging in American social and professional settings.",
