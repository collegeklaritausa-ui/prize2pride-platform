  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are essential tools that help you express different shades of meaning such as ability, permission, obligation, possibility, and advice. They are always followed by the base form of the main verb.\n\nCommon modal verbs include: can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Ability: \"I **can** speak three languages.\"\n- Permission: \"**May** I use your phone?\"\n- Obligation/Necessity: \"You **must** wear a seatbelt.\"\n- Possibility: \"It **might** snow tomorrow.\"\n- Advice: \"You **should** study for the test.\"\n\nNote that modal verbs do not change form for different subjects and are followed directly by the base verb, without 'to'. For example, \"He **can** swim,\" not \"He can to swim.\"\n\nPractice using these modal verbs to express different situations to gain mastery and sound more natural in American English conversations.",
