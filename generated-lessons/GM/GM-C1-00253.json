  "content": "In advanced American English, the passive voice serves as a sophisticated tool to shift focus from the doer to the action or the recipient of the action. Unlike basic passive constructions, advanced passive structures often involve complex tenses, modal verbs, and impersonal forms that enhance clarity and emphasis in formal writing.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **Complex Passive Constructions:** Employing perfect tenses (e.g., 'has been', 'had been') and continuous forms (e.g., 'is being') to describe ongoing or completed actions.\n- **Passive with Modal Verbs:** Using modal auxiliaries (e.g., 'can', 'should', 'must') with passive forms to convey possibility, obligation, or necessity.\n- **Impersonal Passives:** Omitting the agent to create a neutral or objective tone, common in legal, scientific, or bureaucratic language.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: \"Researchers are analyzing the data.\"\n- Passive: \"The data are being analyzed by researchers.\"\n\n- Active: \"The committee will approve the policy.\"\n- Passive: \"The policy will be approved by the committee.\"\n\n- Active: \"They had completed the project before the deadline.\"\n- Passive: \"The project had been completed before the deadline.\"\n\n**Transformative Practice:**\n- Convert complex active sentences into passive forms, paying attention to tense and modality.\n- Use impersonal constructions to express general truths or scientific facts.\n\n**Advanced Tips:**\n- Use passive voice to vary sentence structure and avoid repetition of the subject.\n- Recognize when passive voice enhances formality and objectivity.\n- Be cautious of overusing passive constructions in informal contexts, where active voice may be clearer.",
