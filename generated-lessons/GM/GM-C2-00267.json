  "content": "The passive voice is a key grammatical structure in American English that shifts focus from the doer of the action to the action itself or its recipient. It is formed using the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' + the past participle of the main verb. For example, active: 'The chef prepares the meal.' becomes passive: 'The meal is prepared by the chef.'\n\nPassive voice is especially useful when the agent is unknown, unimportant, or when the emphasis is on the action or recipient. For example, in formal reports or scientific writing, passive voice can add objectivity and clarity.\n\nTo transform an active sentence into passive:\n1. Identify the object of the active sentence.\n2. Move the object to the subject position.\n3. Use the correct form of 'to be' matching the tense.\n4. Add the past participle of the main verb.\n5. Include the original subject with 'by' if necessary.\n\nExample:\nActive: The teacher grades the exams.\nPassive: The exams are graded by the teacher.\n\nNote: Not all sentences work well in passive voice; avoid overusing it to maintain sentence clarity and style.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American professional and academic contexts, passive voice is often used in scientific, technical, and formal writing to focus on results and processes rather than the doer. However, in everyday conversation, active voice is preferred for clarity and directness. Mastery of passive voice allows writers and speakers to communicate more effectively across diverse settings, from business reports to literature, embodying the precision and adaptability valued in American English.",
