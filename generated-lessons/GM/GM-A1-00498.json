  "content": "Welcome to the world of conjunctions, the essential connectors that make your sentences smooth and clear! In American English, conjunctions help you combine ideas, add details, or show contrast.\n\nThere are two main types of conjunctions:\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions:** These join equal parts of a sentence. The most common are **for, and, but, or, yet, so** (F.A.N.B.O.Y.S).\n\n   - Example: I want to go to the park, **but** it rains.\n   - Example: She reads books **and** watches movies.\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions:** These connect a dependent clause to an independent clause, showing relationships like cause, time, or contrast.\n\n   - Examples include **because, although, since, when, if**.\n   - Example: I stayed inside **because** it was raining.\n\n**Tips for using conjunctions:**\n- Use **and** to add ideas.\n- Use **but** to show contrast.\n- Use **or** to present options.\n- Use **because** to give reasons.\n\nPracticing with these will turn you into a master of connecting ideas smoothly!\n\nLet's look at some example sentences:\n- I want coffee **or** tea.\n- She is tired, **but** happy.\n- They went home **because** it was late.\n\nRemember, the key is to choose the right conjunction to make your sentences clear and natural in American English.",
