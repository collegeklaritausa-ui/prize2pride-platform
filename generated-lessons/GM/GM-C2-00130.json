  "content": "In American English, conditionals are essential tools that allow speakers and writers to express facts, possibilities, wishes, and regrets. Mastery over conditionals transforms your communication, making it precise and expressive.\n\n**Zero Conditional:** Used for universal truths and facts. Structure: 'If' + present simple, + present simple.\nExample: \"If you mix red and blue, you get purple.\"\n\n**First Conditional:** Used for real future possibilities. Structure: 'If' + present simple, + will + base verb.\nExample: \"If it rains tomorrow, we will stay indoors.\"\n\n**Second Conditional:** Used for hypothetical situations in the present or future. Structure: 'If' + past simple, + would + base verb.\nExample: \"If I had a million dollars, I would buy a house.\"\n\n**Third Conditional:** Used for hypothetical situations in the past; regrets or missed opportunities. Structure: 'If' + past perfect, + would have + past participle.\nExample: \"If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.\"\n\n**Mixed Conditionals:** Combine different times and realities, often to express past hypotheticals affecting the present. Example: \"If I had taken that job, I would be living abroad now.\"\n\nRemember, mastering conditionals enables precise expression of reality, possibilities, and regrets—cornerstones of compelling American English communication.",
