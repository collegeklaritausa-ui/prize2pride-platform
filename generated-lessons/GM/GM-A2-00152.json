  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are essential tools that help us express different meanings related to ability, permission, obligation, and possibility. Modal verbs are always followed by the base form of the main verb. They do not change form according to the subject.\n\nCommon modal verbs include:\n- **Can**: Express ability or permission. e.g., \"I **can** speak three languages.\"\n- **Could**: Past ability or polite permission. e.g., \"When I was a child, I **could** run fast.\"\n- **May**: Formal permission or possibility. e.g., \"**May** I leave early today?\"\n- **Might**: Suggests possibility. e.g., \"It **might** snow tomorrow.\"\n- **Must**: Obligation or strong necessity. e.g., \"You **must** wear a seatbelt.\"\n- **Should**: Advice or suggestion. e.g., \"You **should** eat more vegetables.\"\n- **Will**: Future intention or promise. e.g., \"I **will** call you tomorrow.\"\n\nRemember, modal verbs are used at the beginning of the verb phrase and do not have ‘s’, ‘ed’, or ‘ing’ endings. For example: \"He **can** help us,\" not \"He **cans** help us.\"\n\nLet’s look at some example sentences:\n- Ability: \"She **can** play the piano.\"\n- Permission: \"**May** I sit here?\"\n- Obligation: \"You **must** finish your homework.\"\n- Possibility: \"They **might** visit us this weekend.\"\n\nPracticing these will help you become confident in expressing different ideas in American English!\n",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, modal verbs are used frequently in both formal and informal contexts. Saying 'Can I?' or 'May I?' is common when requesting permission, with 'Can I?' being more casual and 'May I?' more formal. Understanding and correctly using modal verbs can help you sound polite, confident, and clear in your communication, whether you're making a request, giving advice, or talking about possibilities. Remember, Americans value directness and clarity, so mastering modal verbs will help you express yourself effectively and politely.",
