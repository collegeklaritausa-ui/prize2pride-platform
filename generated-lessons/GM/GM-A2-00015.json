  "content": "Welcome to your journey to become a master of American English verb tenses! Today, we will focus on three main tenses: present, past, and future.\n\n**1. Present Tense:**\nUse the present tense to talk about things happening now or regularly. The base form of the verb is used for most subjects, except for he, she, it, where you add an -s.\n- Example: I walk to school. / She walks to school.\n\n**2. Past Tense:**\nUse the past tense to describe actions that already happened. Regular verbs add -ed at the end. Irregular verbs change form completely.\n- Example: I played soccer yesterday. / He went to the store.\n\n**3. Future Tense:**\nUse the future tense to talk about things that will happen. Often, 'will' is used before the base form of the verb.\n- Example: I will visit my friend tomorrow.\n\n**Quick Tip:** Remember, the key to mastering verb tenses is practice! Try to think about what you do daily, what you did yesterday, and what you will do tomorrow, and form sentences accordingly.\n\nLet's practice with some examples:\n- Present: I eat breakfast every morning.\n- Past: I watched a movie last night.\n- Future: I will learn English better.\n\nBy practicing these forms, you'll soon speak with confidence and clarity!",
