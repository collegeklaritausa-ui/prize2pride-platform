  "content": "Welcome to the world of reported speech! In American English, reported speech is used to tell what someone else has said without quoting exactly. For example, if someone says, 'I am hungry,' you can report it as, 'They said they were hungry.' \n\nWhen transforming direct speech into reported speech, tense shifts are essential. Typically, present tense verbs change to past tense, and time expressions like 'today' switch to 'that day.'\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: She said, 'I will go to the store.'\n- Reported: She said she would go to the store.\n\n- Direct: He said, 'I like this movie.'\n- Reported: He said he liked that movie.\n\nRemember, when the reporting verb is in the past tense (said, told), tense shifts are usually necessary. However, if the reporting verb is in the present, tense changes might not be needed.\n\n**Key rules:**\n- Present simple → Past simple\n- Present continuous → Past continuous\n- Present perfect → Past perfect\n- Will → Would\n\nUsing reported speech helps make your storytelling and conversations more natural and fluent in American English! \n\nLet's practice transforming sentences together!",
