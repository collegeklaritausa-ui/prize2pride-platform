  "content": "Welcome to the world of modal verbs, the secret power tools in your American English toolkit! Modal verbs help you express your ability, possibilities, permissions, and obligations clearly and politely. Let's explore the most common modal verbs:\n\n- **Can**: Express ability or possibility. \n  *Example:* I **can** swim.\n\n- **Could**: Past ability or polite permission. \n  *Example:* **Could** you help me?\n\n- **May**: Formal permission or possibility. \n  *Example:* **May** I leave early?\n\n- **Might**: Possibility, less certain than may. \n  *Example:* It **might** rain today.\n\n- **Must**: Strong obligation or certainty. \n  *Example:* You **must** wear a seatbelt.\n\n- **Shall**: Offer or suggestion, often used in formal contexts. \n  *Example:* **Shall** we dance?\n\n- **Should**: Advice or recommendation. \n  *Example:* You **should** study harder.\n\n- **Will**: Future intention or promise. \n  *Example:* I **will** call you tomorrow.\n\n- **Would**: Polite requests or hypothetical situations. \n  *Example:* **Would** you like some coffee?\n\nRemember, modal verbs do not change form according to the subject. They are followed directly by the base verb (without 'to').\n\nExample sentences to practice:\n- I **can** speak English.\n- She **must** finish her work.\n- They **might** come to the party.\n\nPractice using these modal verbs in your sentences to become more confident in expressing yourself in American English!",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, modal verbs are used politely and respectfully, especially when making requests or giving advice. For example, saying 'May I' instead of 'Can I' can sound more formal or polite. Understanding these nuances helps you communicate effectively and respectfully in everyday American interactions, from casual conversations to professional settings.",
