  "content": "Welcome to the world of American English! Today, we focus on understanding and using the three basic verb tenses: present, past, and future. These tenses help you talk about what you do, what you did, and what you will do.\n\n1. Simple Present Tense:\n- Use for habits, routines, facts, and truths.\n- Example: I eat breakfast every morning.\n- Structure: Subject + base verb (add 's' or 'es' for he, she, it)\n- Example sentences:\n  - I play soccer.\n  - She works at a bank.\n\n2. Simple Past Tense:\n- Use for completed actions in the past.\n- Example: They visited the museum yesterday.\n- Structure: Subject + past tense of the verb (regular verbs end with -ed)\n- Example sentences:\n  - I watched a movie.\n  - He studied for the test.\n\n3. Simple Future Tense:\n- Use for actions that will happen.\n- Example: We will go to the park tomorrow.\n- Structure: Subject + will + base verb\n- Example sentences:\n  - I will call you later.\n  - They will travel next week.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Understanding these tenses allows you to speak clearly about your routines, past experiences, and future plans. Keep practicing with everyday sentences to become a true GOD of American English!",
