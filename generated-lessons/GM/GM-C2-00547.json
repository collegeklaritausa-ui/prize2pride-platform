  "content": "Conjunctions are the glue that holds our sentences together, allowing us to express complex ideas with clarity and style. In American English, mastery of conjunctions elevates your writing and speaking from simple to sophisticated.\n\n**Types of Conjunctions:**\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions:** These are the most common, connecting words or groups of words of equal grammatical rank. Remember the mnemonic FANBOYS:\n   - For\n   - And\n   - Nor\n   - But\n   - Or\n   - Yet\n   - So\n\n   *Example:* I wanted to buy a new car, but I didn’t have enough money.\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce subordinate clauses, providing reasons, contrasts, conditions, or time relationships.\n\n   *Examples include:* because, since, although, unless, if, when, while, after.\n\n   *Example:* She canceled her plans because she was feeling ill.\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions:** These work in pairs to connect equal grammatical items.\n\n   *Examples include:* either...or, neither...nor, both...and, not only...but also.\n\n   *Example:* Neither the manager nor the employees knew about the change.\n\n**Practical Tips:**\n- Use coordinating conjunctions to combine simple ideas.\n- Employ subordinating conjunctions to express relationships like cause and effect or contrast.\n- Use correlative conjunctions to emphasize parallel ideas.\n- Avoid comma splices by ensuring proper separation of independent clauses.\n\n**Advanced Usage:**\nIn masterful writing, conjunctions can be used to create rhythm and emphasis. For example, starting a sentence with 'Although' adds a formal tone, while using 'and' repeatedly can create a flowing, poetic effect.\n\nBy mastering conjunctions, you will transform your sentences from basic to brilliant, demonstrating mastery of American English grammar.",
