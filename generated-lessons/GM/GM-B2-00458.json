  "content": "Prepositions are essential building blocks of fluent American English. They connect nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other parts of the sentence, indicating relationships such as location, direction, time, or possession. For example, in the sentence 'The keys are on the counter,' the preposition 'on' shows the location of the keys.\n\nCommon prepositions include: at, on, in, over, under, between, beside, near, during, before, after, with, about, and to. Mastery of prepositions involves understanding their correct usage within prepositional phrases and recognizing idiomatic expressions.\n\nOne common challenge is choosing the correct preposition, as many words have multiple prepositional counterparts depending on context. For example, 'interested in,' 'good at,' 'depend on.'\n\nIn complex sentences, prepositional phrases can act as modifiers, providing additional details. Example: 'She arrived **after** the meeting **ended**.'\n\nRemember, prepositions are often idiomatic; thus, exposure to authentic American English through reading, listening, and practice is crucial for mastery.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, prepositions are often used in idiomatic expressions that reflect social norms and everyday life. For example, 'meet me **at** the corner' or 'we'll see you **on** Saturday.' Understanding these common phrases and their prepositional context helps non-native speakers integrate more seamlessly into American social and professional environments. Additionally, Americans tend to favor direct and clear communication, so precise preposition usage enhances clarity and confidence in conversation.",
