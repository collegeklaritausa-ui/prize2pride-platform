  "content": "Welcome to your journey of becoming a GOD of American English! Today, we dive into the powerful skill of reported speech, a key element in everyday conversations and writing.\n\n**What is Reported Speech?**\nReported speech is used when you want to tell someone what another person said, but you don't quote their exact words. Instead, you paraphrase or summarize.\n\n**Direct vs. Indirect Speech**\n- *Direct Speech*: Exactly what someone said, with quotation marks.\n  - Example: He said, 'I am happy.'\n- *Indirect Speech*: What someone said, reported without quotation marks, often with changes.\n  - Example: He said that he was happy.\n\n**Important Rules**:\n- Change the tense back (present to past, etc.)\n- Adjust pronouns accordingly\n- Remove quotation marks\n- Use reporting verbs like 'say', 'tell', 'ask'\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: She said, 'I can help you.'\n- Indirect: She said that she could help me.\n\n**Tips for Using Reported Speech:**\n- Use 'tell' when giving information to someone: 'He told me he was tired.'\n- Use 'say' for general statements: 'She said she was hungry.'\n\nPractice makes perfect! With these rules, you'll soon master transforming direct quotes into smooth, natural reported speech.\n\nLet's move on to some exercises to test your skills!",
