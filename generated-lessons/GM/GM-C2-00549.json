  "content": "Conjunctions are the glue that holds your sentences together, making your communication smooth and clear. Mastering conjunctions transforms basic sentences into complex, nuanced expressions that reflect the richness of American English. \n\n**Types of Conjunctions:**\n\n1. **Coordinating Conjunctions:** These are the most common and include for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so (FANBOYS). They join words or independent clauses:\n   - Example: I wanted to call you, but I lost my phone.\n\n2. **Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce dependent clauses and show relationships like contrast, cause, or condition:\n   - Example: Since you arrived late, we started without you.\n\n3. **Correlative Conjunctions:** These work in pairs to connect equivalent parts of a sentence:\n   - Example: Neither the chef nor the waiter was available.\n\n**Tips for Mastery:**\n- Use coordinating conjunctions to create compound sentences.\n- Use subordinating conjunctions to add depth and detail.\n- Incorporate correlative conjunctions for emphasis and balance.\n- Avoid comma splices by properly punctuating with conjunctions.\n\n**Example Sentences:**\n- Coordinating: She loves music, and she plays the guitar.\n- Subordinating: Although he was tired, he continued working.\n- Correlative: Either you apologize, or I will leave.\n\nPracticing these will elevate your American English to a level where you connect ideas effortlessly and persuasively.",
