  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, prepositions are often used in idiomatic expressions and colloquial speech that may differ from formal grammar rules. For example, Americans frequently say, \"I'm going to the store\" instead of \"I'm going to the store\"; the preposition 'to' indicates direction. Additionally, prepositional phrases are common in everyday conversation, emphasizing relationships and spatial awareness central to American social interactions. Mastering prepositions will help you understand and participate more naturally in American communication and cultural nuances.",
