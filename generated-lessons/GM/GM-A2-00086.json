  "content": "Welcome to the lesson on conditionals, a fundamental part of American English! Conditionals help us talk about real and possible situations. There are mainly two types at the elementary level:\n\n1. Zero Conditional: Used for facts or general truths. Structure: If + present simple, + present simple.\n   - Example: If you heat ice, it melts.\n\n2. First Conditional: Used for real future possibilities. Structure: If + present simple, + will + verb.\n   - Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will stay home.\n\nLet's look at some examples:\n- Zero Conditional: If you add sugar to tea, it tastes sweet.\n- First Conditional: If you study hard, you will pass the test.\n\nRemember, in American English, the 'if' clause can sometimes come at the end of the sentence:\n- You will stay inside if it rains.\n\nPractice forming these sentences in positive and negative forms:\n- Positive Zero Conditional: If you cook dinner, I help set the table.\n- Negative Zero Conditional: If you don’t water plants, they die.\n- Positive First Conditional: If you go to the park, I will join you.\n- Negative First Conditional: If you don’t study, you won’t pass.\n\nUsing conditionals correctly helps in daily conversations, giving advice, making plans, or talking about facts. Keep practicing to become a true GOD of American English conditionals!",
