  "content": "Welcome to the world of American English grammar! Today, we focus on the passive voice, a way to emphasize the action or the recipient of an action rather than who is doing it.\n\nIn active sentences, the subject performs the action: 'Sarah bakes the cake.' The focus is on Sarah. \n\nIn passive sentences, the focus shifts to the cake, which receives the action: 'The cake was baked by Sarah.' Notice the structure:\n\n- The object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence.\n- The verb is changed to a form of 'be' + the past participle of the main verb.\n- The doer of the action (agent) can be included with 'by' or omitted if unknown or unimportant.\n\n**Forming the passive voice:**\n\n1. Identify the object of the active sentence.\n2. Use the correct form of 'be' + past participle of the main verb.\n3. (Optional) Add 'by' + the doer of the action.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The teacher explains the lesson.\n- Passive: The lesson **is explained** by the teacher.\n\nTry transforming these active sentences into passive:\n- The dog chased the ball.\n- They will complete the project.\n\nRemember, the passive voice is useful in many situations, especially when the focus is on the action or when the doer is unknown or unimportant.\n\nKeep practicing to become a passive voice master!",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, the passive voice is often used in formal writing, reports, and news articles to emphasize the action or the object rather than the doer. For example, in news headlines, the focus is typically on the event itself, e.g., 'The bridge was damaged in the storm.' Understanding passive constructions helps in both understanding and creating clear, professional communication in American English.",
