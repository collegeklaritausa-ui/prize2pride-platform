  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, polite requests often involve modal verbs like 'could' or 'would,' especially in formal or polite contexts. Understanding how to use modal verbs appropriately helps you sound respectful and confident. For example, saying 'Could you help me?' is polite and friendly. Americans value directness combined with politeness, and mastery of modal verbs is key to effective communication in social and professional settings.",
