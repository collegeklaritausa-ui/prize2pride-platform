  "content": "Welcome to your journey to becoming a god of American English! Today, we focus on the basics of verb tenses, essential tools for expressing time.\n\nFirst, let's understand the three main tenses:\n\n1. Present Tense:\n- Used to talk about routines, facts, and general truths.\n- Example: I eat breakfast every morning.\n\n2. Past Tense:\n- Used to describe actions that happened before now.\n- Example: She played soccer yesterday.\n\n3. Future Tense:\n- Used for actions that will happen later.\n- Example: We will go shopping tomorrow.\n\nRemember, regular verbs in the past often add '-ed' (walk → walked), but some verbs are irregular (go → went).\n\nNow, practice simple sentences:\n- Present: I work at a store.\n- Past: I worked yesterday.\n- Future: I will work tomorrow.\n\nMastering these basics helps you communicate clearly about when things happen. Keep practicing by forming your own sentences with each tense!",
