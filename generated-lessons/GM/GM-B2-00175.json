  "content": "In American English, modal verbs are essential tools for expressing a wide range of meanings succinctly and effectively. They help convey ability (can, could), permission (may, might), obligation (must, should), and possibility (might, may). For example:\n\n- Ability: I can speak three languages.\n- Permission: May I borrow your car?\n- Obligation: You must wear a seatbelt.\n- Possibility: It might rain today.\n\nModal verbs are followed by the base form of the main verb without 'to'. For instance: 'She should study more.'\n\nIt's important to understand the subtle differences between modal verbs. For example, 'should' suggests advice or recommendation, while 'must' indicates a strong obligation. Similarly, 'may' and 'might' both express possibility, but 'may' is often used for permission.\n\nIn questions and negatives, modal verbs are placed before the subject:\n- Question: Can you help me?\n- Negative: I cannot attend the meeting.\n\nRemember, modal verbs do not change form for different subjects or tenses, but they are often used with other auxiliary forms to indicate past or future nuances (e.g., could have, should have). Mastery of modal verbs will make your communication more precise and nuanced, elevating your American English skills to a mastery level.",
