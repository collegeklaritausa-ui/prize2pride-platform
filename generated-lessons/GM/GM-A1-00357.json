  "content": "In American English, articles are small words that come before nouns to provide more information about the noun. There are three main articles:\n\n1. 'A' and 'An' are indefinite articles. Use 'a' before words that begin with a consonant sound, and 'an' before words that begin with a vowel sound. Example: 'a car,' 'an apple.'\n\n2. 'The' is the definite article. Use it when referring to a specific item known to both the speaker and listener. Example: 'the book on the table.'\n\nTips for choosing the correct article:\n- Use 'a' or 'an' when mentioning something for the first time.\n- Use 'the' when talking about something specific or previously mentioned.\n- Remember, the choice depends on the sound, not just the letter. For example, 'an hour' (because 'hour' starts with a vowel sound), not 'a hour.'\n\nExamples:\n- I saw a bird in the park.\n- The bird was singing loudly.\n- She wants to buy an umbrella.\n- Can you see the moon?\n\nUsing articles correctly makes your speech and writing clearer and more natural, helping you become a true GOD of American English!",
