  "content": "Welcome to the realm of American English sentence structure, where clarity and variety elevate your communication. At the intermediate level, mastering sentence construction enables you to express ideas with nuance and sophistication.\n\n**Basic Components:**\n- **Subject:** Who or what the sentence is about.\n- **Predicate:** What is said about the subject, typically containing a verb.\n\n**Simple Sentences:**\n- Consist of one independent clause.\n- Example: \"The dog barked.\"\n\n**Compound Sentences:**\n- Combine two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, so, yet, for, nor).\n- Example: \"I wanted coffee, but the store was closed.\"\n\n**Complex Sentences:**\n- Contain one independent clause and at least one dependent clause introduced by subordinating conjunctions (because, although, since, if, when).\n- Example: \"I stayed inside because it was raining.\"\n\n**Punctuation Tips:**\n- Use commas before coordinating conjunctions in compound sentences.\n- Use subordinating conjunctions at the beginning of dependent clauses.\n- Proper punctuation ensures sentence clarity and flow.\n\n**Transforming Sentences:**\n- Combine sentences for variety:\n  - Simple: \"She studies. She listens to music.\"\n  - Combined: \"She studies while she listens to music.\"\n- Add modifiers for emphasis or detail:\n  - Basic: \"He runs.\"\n  - Enhanced: \"He runs vigorously every morning.\"\n\nUnderstanding and applying these structures will turn your ordinary sentences into powerful tools of expression, making you a true GOD of American English sentence mastery.",
