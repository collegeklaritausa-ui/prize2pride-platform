  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, reporting speech often uses a friendly and informal tone, especially in casual conversations. Americans value clarity and directness, so when reporting speech, it's common to adjust the formality based on the relationship and context. When reporting questions, Americans frequently use 'if' and 'whether' and may omit auxiliary verbs in casual speech. Understanding these nuances helps in sounding natural and maintaining conversational flow in American English.",
