  "content": "In American English, mastering verb tenses is essential for clear and precise communication. There are twelve major tenses, grouped into simple, perfect, continuous (progressive), and perfect continuous forms.\n\n**1. Present Tenses:**\n- *Simple Present:* Describes habitual actions or general truths. (e.g., 'She works at a bank.')\n- *Present Continuous:* Describes actions happening right now. (e.g., 'She is working now.')\n- *Present Perfect:* Describes actions that occurred at an unspecified time before now. (e.g., 'She has worked here for five years.')\n- *Present Perfect Continuous:* Emphasizes the duration of an ongoing action. (e.g., 'She has been working since morning.')\n\n**2. Past Tenses:**\n- *Simple Past:* Actions completed in the past. (e.g., 'She worked yesterday.')\n- *Past Continuous:* Actions ongoing in the past. (e.g., 'She was working when I called.')\n- *Past Perfect:* Actions completed before another past action. (e.g., 'She had finished before he arrived.')\n- *Past Perfect Continuous:* Duration of an action up to a certain point in the past. (e.g., 'She had been working for hours before she took a break.')\n\n**3. Future Tenses:**\n- *Simple Future:* Actions that will happen. (e.g., 'She will work tomorrow.')\n- *Future Continuous:* Ongoing future actions. (e.g., 'She will be working at that time.')\n- *Future Perfect:* Actions that will be completed by a certain future time. (e.g., 'She will have finished by then.')\n- *Future Perfect Continuous:* Duration of future actions up to a point. (e.g., 'She will have been working for five hours by noon.')\n\n**Examples and Usage Tips:**\n- Use the simple present for facts and routines.\n- Use the present perfect for experiences and actions affecting the present.\n- Combine tense with context to convey precise timing.\n- Be mindful of irregular verb forms.\n\nMastering these tenses enables you to speak and write with confidence, clarity, and accuracy—true mastery of American English grammar.",
