  "content": "Passive voice is a way of constructing sentences where the focus is shifted from the doer of the action to the receiver of the action. In active voice, the subject performs the action, e.g., 'The chef cooked a delicious meal.' In passive voice, the focus is on the recipient: 'A delicious meal was cooked by the chef.'\n\n**Forming Passive Voice:**\n- Identify the object in an active sentence.\n- Move that object to the subject position.\n- Use the correct form of 'be' (am, is, are, was, were, etc.) matching the tense.\n- Add the past participle of the main verb.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The students completed the project.\n- Passive: The project was completed by the students.\n\n**When to Use Passive Voice:**\n- When the doer is unknown or unimportant.\n- To emphasize the action or the receiver.\n- In formal or scientific writing.\n\n**Note:** Overusing passive voice can make writing less direct or engaging. Use it judiciously to enhance clarity and flow.\n\n**Transforming Sentences:**\n- Active: The company will launch the new product.\n- Passive: The new product will be launched by the company.",
