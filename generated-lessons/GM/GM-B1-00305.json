  "content": "Reported speech is a fundamental aspect of American English that allows you to convey what someone else has said without quoting them directly. It's commonly used in conversations, news reports, and storytelling to make speech more concise and indirect.\n\n**Key Rules:**\n\n1. **Reporting Verbs:** Use verbs like 'say', 'tell', 'ask', 'explain', or 'suggest' to introduce the reported speech.\n\n2. **Tense Changes:** Usually, the tense shifts back in reported speech:\n   - Present simple → Past simple\n   - Present continuous → Past continuous\n   - Present perfect → Past perfect\n   - Past simple → Past perfect\n   - Will → Would\n\n3. **Pronoun and Time Expression Changes:** Adjust pronouns and time references to fit the context:\n   - 'I' becomes 'he'/'she'\n   - 'today' becomes 'that day'\n   - 'tomorrow' becomes 'the next day'\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Direct: She said, \"I am tired.\"\n  - Reported: She said she was tired.\n\n- Direct: He asked, \"Are you coming?\"\n  - Reported: He asked if I was coming.\n\n- Direct: They said, \"We will visit tomorrow.\"\n  - Reported: They said they would visit the next day.\n\nBy mastering reported speech, you'll be able to communicate more naturally and understand others better in American English contexts, whether in casual chats or formal reports.",
