  "content": "Welcome to your journey to becoming a GOD of American English! Today, we focus on modal verbs, which are special words that help us express ability, permission, obligation, advice, and future actions.\n\n**What are Modal Verbs?**\nModal verbs are auxiliary (helping) verbs that add meaning to the main verb in a sentence. They do not change form for different subjects.\n\n**Common Modal Verbs in American English:**\n- can (ability, possibility)\n- must (obligation, strong suggestion)\n- should (advice, recommendation)\n- may (permission, possibility)\n- will (future intention)\n\n**Examples:**\n- I can swim.\n- You must see the doctor.\n- We should study more.\n- May I use your phone?\n- He will arrive tomorrow.\n\n**Using Modal Verbs Correctly:**\n- Place the modal before the base form of the main verb.\n- Do not add ‘s’ or ‘ed’ to modal verbs.\n- Use 'must' for strong obligation, 'should' for advice, and 'may' for permission.\n\n**Practice Tip:**\nThink about your daily routine and try to make sentences using different modal verbs. For example, \"I can wake up early,\" or \"I should call my friend.\"\n\nWith practice, you'll command these modal verbs like a true American English GOD!",

Americans value clarity and politeness, so modals like 'may' and 'could' are often used to make polite requests. Mastering modal verbs will help you sound confident and courteous in American social and professional settings.",
