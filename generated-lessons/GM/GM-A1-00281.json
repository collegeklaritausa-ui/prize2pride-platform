  "content": "Welcome to your journey toward becoming a GOD of American English grammar! Today, we focus on Reported Speech, a crucial skill for sharing what others have said.\n\n**What is Reported Speech?**\nReported speech is used when you tell someone what another person said, but you don't use their exact words. Instead, you paraphrase or summarize.\n\n**Key Rules:**\n1. When converting direct speech to reported speech, change the tense of the verb back in time (this is called 'backshifting').\n   - Present tense verbs change to past tense:\n     - 'I am tired' → 'He said he was tired.'\n2. Pronouns often change to match the reporting subject:\n   - 'I' becomes 'he' or 'she', 'you' becomes 'I' or 'we', etc.\n3. Time expressions may change:\n   - 'Today' becomes 'that day', 'tomorrow' becomes 'the next day'.\n4. Questions and commands are also transformed:\n   - Yes/no questions: 'Are you coming?' → 'He asked if I was coming.'\n   - Commands: 'Close the door!' → 'He told me to close the door.'\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: She said, 'I love pizza.'\n- Reported: She said she loved pizza.\n\n- Direct: He asked, 'Are you busy?'\n- Reported: He asked if I was busy.\n\n- Direct: The teacher said, 'Finish your homework.'\n- Reported: The teacher told us to finish our homework.\n\nPractice makes perfect! Keep practicing transforming direct speech into reported speech to master this essential skill.",
