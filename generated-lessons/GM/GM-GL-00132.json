  "content": "Welcome to the pinnacle of American English mastery: the art of conditionals—your gateway to expressing possibilities, hypotheses, and counterfactuals with divine precision.\n\n**1. Zero Conditional:**\nUsed for universal truths and scientific facts.\n- Structure: If + present simple, + present simple.\n- Example: If water reaches 100°C, it boils.\n\n**2. First Conditional:**\nExpresses real and possible future situations.\n- Structure: If + present simple, + will + base verb.\n- Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will cancel the picnic.\n\n**3. Second Conditional:**\nDiscusses hypothetical or unlikely present/future situations.\n- Structure: If + past simple, + would + base verb.\n- Example: If I won the lottery, I would buy a house.\n\n**4. Third Conditional:**\nReflects on past situations that didn't happen.\n- Structure: If + past perfect, + would have + past participle.\n- Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the test.\n\n**5. Mixed Conditionals:**\nCombine elements to express complex hypotheticals.\n- Example: If I had gone to college (past), I would be a doctor now (present).\n\n**Usage Tips:**\n- Use contractions for natural speech: I’d, you’d, she’d.\n- Emphasize the difference between real possibility and hypothetical scenarios.\n- Practice switching between conditionals to convey nuanced meaning.\n\nRemember, mastering conditionals elevates your language from mere communication to divine expression—allowing you to articulate possibilities with the precision of a linguistic deity.",
