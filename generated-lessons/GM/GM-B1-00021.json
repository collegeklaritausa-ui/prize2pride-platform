  "content": "Welcome to Lesson #21: Verb Tenses—your gateway to mastering the timing of actions in American English. Understanding verb tenses is essential for clear communication, whether you’re telling a story, describing routines, or discussing future plans.\n\n**Present Simple**: Used for routines, facts, and general truths. \n- Example: 'I study every day.'\n\n**Present Continuous**: Describes actions happening right now or temporary situations.\n- Example: 'I am studying for my exam.'\n\n**Past Simple**: Refers to completed actions at a specific time in the past.\n- Example: 'I visited New York last year.'\n\n**Future Simple**: Expresses actions that will happen in the future.\n- Example: 'I will travel to California next month.'\n\n**Key Tips:**\n- Use the base verb + 's' for third person singular in Present Simple.\n- Add '-ing' to form the Present Continuous.\n- Use the past form of the verb for Past Simple.\n- Use 'will' + base verb for Future Simple.\n\nPracticing these tenses in context will make you fluent and confident in American English. Remember, native speakers often use contractions like 'I'm,' 'He's,' and 'They'll,' which you should incorporate into your speech to sound natural.\n\nLet's see how these tenses function in everyday sentences:\n- Present Simple: 'She works at a bank.'\n- Present Continuous: 'She is working on a project.'\n- Past Simple: 'She worked there for five years.'\n- Future Simple: 'She will start a new job next week.'\n\nMaster these tenses, and you'll speak and write American English with the authority of a true GOD!",
