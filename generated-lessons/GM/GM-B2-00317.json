  "content": "To master reported speech in American English, you need to understand the key transformations involved. When converting direct speech into reported speech, several shifts typically occur:\n\n1. **Tense Shift:** Generally, present tense verbs change to past tense.\n   - Direct: She says, 'I like coffee.'\n   - Reported: She said she liked coffee.\n\n2. **Pronoun Shift:** Pronouns are adjusted based on the context.\n   - Direct: John said, 'I will call you.'\n   - Reported: John said he would call me.\n\n3. **Time and Place Expressions:** These need to be adapted.\n   - Direct: He said, 'I saw her yesterday.'\n   - Reported: He said he had seen her the previous day.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct: She told me, 'I'm going to the store.'\n- Reported: She told me she was going to the store.\n\n- Direct: They said, 'We have finished our homework.'\n- Reported: They said they had finished their homework.\n\n**Special notes:**\n- If the reporting verb is in the present or future, tense shifts may be optional.\n- Use 'say' or 'tell' depending on whether a speaker or listener is emphasized.\n- When the direct speech includes questions, change word order and use 'ask' or 'inquire.'\n\n**Questions and Commands:**\n- Questions are reported with 'ask' + question word or 'if'/'whether' for yes/no questions.\n- Commands or requests use 'tell' + object + to-infinitive.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Direct question: 'Do you like pizza?'\n- Reported: He asked if I liked pizza.\n\n- Direct command: 'Close the door.'\n- Reported: She told me to close the door.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, reporting speech is often used in casual conversations, interviews, and media. Americans tend to favor clear and straightforward communication, so accurate transformation of speech enhances understanding and professionalism. When quoting someone, maintaining the original tone and intent is appreciated, especially in journalism and storytelling. Additionally, Americans value the use of 'say' and 'tell' appropriately, with 'say' used more for spoken words and 'tell' for giving information or instructions. Mastery of reported speech reflects mastery of clarity, politeness, and effective communication in American English.",
