  "content": "The passive voice is a grammatical structure used to emphasize the action or the recipient of an action rather than the doer. In American English, passive constructions are common in formal writing, news reports, and situations where the actor is unknown or unimportant.\n\n**Forming the Passive Voice:**\n- Use the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' + the past participle of the main verb.\n- The structure varies with tense:\n  - Present Simple: is/are + past participle (e.g., The report is prepared daily.)\n  - Past Simple: was/were + past participle (e.g., The cake was baked by John.)\n  - Present Continuous: is/are + being + past participle (e.g., The emails are being sent now.)\n  - Present Perfect: has/have been + past participle (e.g., The documents have been approved.)\n  - Future: will be + past participle (e.g., The package will be shipped tomorrow.)\n\n**Active to Passive Transformation:**\n- Identify the object, the subject, and the verb.\n- Move the object to the subject position.\n- Change the verb into the correct form of 'to be' + past participle.\n- Include the agent if necessary, introduced by 'by'.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The teacher grades the exams.\n- Passive: The exams are graded by the teacher.\n\n**When to Use Passive Voice:**\n- When the doer is unknown or unimportant.\n- To emphasize the action or the recipient.\n- To create a formal tone.\n\n**Note:** While passive voice is useful, overusing it can make sentences unclear or cumbersome. Use it judiciously to balance clarity and emphasis.",
