  "content": "Understanding sentence structure is essential for mastering American English. Sentences are made up of clauses, which are groups of words containing a subject and a predicate. An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence, while a dependent clause cannot. Combining these clauses appropriately allows you to craft simple, compound, and complex sentences.\n\nSimple sentences contain only one independent clause, such as 'The dog barked.'\n\nTo form a compound sentence, join two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) or a semicolon: 'The sun set, and the stars appeared.'\n\nComplex sentences combine an independent clause with one or more dependent clauses, often introduced by subordinating conjunctions like because, although, or when: 'She stayed home because it was raining.'\n\nPracticing variety in sentence structures enhances your writing style and clarity. Be mindful of common errors such as comma splices or run-on sentences, and learn to revise them for correct structure.\n\nMastering these structures will help you communicate more effectively and elevate your command of American English to a GOD level.",
