  "content": "In advanced American English, conjunctions serve as the glue that holds sentences together, allowing you to craft nuanced, coherent, and stylistically sophisticated statements. There are three main types: coordinating, subordinating, and correlative conjunctions.\n\n**1. Coordinating Conjunctions:** These are FANBOYS (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So). They link words or groups of equal importance. For example:\n- 'He wanted to stay, but he had to leave early.'\nUse coordinating conjunctions to join simple ideas or to create compound sentences.\n\n**2. Subordinating Conjunctions:** These introduce dependent clauses that provide additional information or contrast. Common subordinators include although, because, since, unless, whereas, while, and even though.\n- 'She excelled in her studies because she studied diligently.'\nMastering these allows you to express complex relationships and subtle distinctions.\n\n**3. Correlative Conjunctions:** These work in pairs to connect equivalent elements, adding balance and emphasis.\n- 'Not only did she win the race, but she also set a new record.'\nEffective use of correlative conjunctions enhances the rhythm and sophistication of your language.\n\n**Advanced Usage Tips:**\n- Avoid comma splices by correctly placing commas around clauses.\n- Use conjunctions to create rhetorical effects, such as contrast or emphasis.\n- Incorporate less common conjunctions like 'inasmuch as' or 'given that' for formal writing.\n\nBy mastering these conjunctions, you will elevate your ability to create complex, elegant sentences that reflect the richness of American English.",
