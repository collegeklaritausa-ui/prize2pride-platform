First Conditional (Real future possibilities)\n   - Structure: If + present simple, ... will + base verb\n   - Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will stay indoors.\n\n3. Second Conditional (Unreal present or future)\n   - Structure: If + past simple, ... would + base verb\n   - Example: If I were taller, I would join the basketball team.\n\n4. Third Conditional (Unreal past)\n   - Structure: If + past perfect, ... would have + past participle\n   - Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.\n\n**Using Conditionals in Context:**\n- Real situations often use the zero and first conditionals.\n- Hypothetical or unlikely scenarios typically employ the second and third conditionals.\n\n**Important Tips:**\n- Remember that in formal American English, 'were' is used with all subjects in the second conditional.\n- Always pay attention to verb tense consistency.\n- Conditionals can be combined for complex ideas.\n\nBy mastering these structures, you will be able to articulate possibilities, regrets, and hypothetical situations with precision and confidence, elevating your American English to a godly level!",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, the use of conditionals often reflects a pragmatic approach to possibilities and regrets. Native speakers frequently use 'if' clauses to express future plans, hypothetical situations, or regrets about the past, which are common in everyday conversations and media. Mastery of conditionals enables learners to communicate complex ideas, wishes, and regrets effectively, aligning with American values of innovation, opportunity, and self-expression.",
