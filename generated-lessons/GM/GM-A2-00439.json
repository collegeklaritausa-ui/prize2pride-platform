  "content": "Welcome to your journey to becoming a GOD of American English grammar! Today, we focus on prepositions, which are tiny words with big power. Prepositions connect nouns or pronouns to other parts of the sentence, showing relationships of location, direction, time, and more.\n\nFor example:\n- Location: The keys are in my pocket.\n- Direction: He is going to the store.\n- Time: We will meet at 5 p.m.\n\nCommon prepositions include: in, on, at, under, over, between, to, from, with, about.\n\nRemember:\n- Prepositions are always followed by a noun or pronoun.\n- They help clarify where, when, or how something happens.\n\nLet's look at some simple sentences:\n- The dog sits **on** the mat.\n- She walks **to** the park.\n- The picture is **above** the sofa.\n\nMastering prepositions makes your sentences clear and natural, helping you communicate confidently in American English!",
