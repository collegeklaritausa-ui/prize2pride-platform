  "content": "Welcome to your journey to becoming a GOD of American English! Today, we dive into the powerful tool of reported speech, which allows you to share what others have said without quoting them exactly. In American English, reported speech is commonly used in everyday conversations, news, and storytelling.\n\n**Direct Speech vs. Reported Speech**:\n- Direct Speech: \"I am hungry,\" she said.\n- Reported Speech: She said she was hungry.\n\nNotice how the tense shifts back (present to past), and pronouns may change.\n\n**Steps to Convert Using Reported Speech**:\n1. Remove the quotation marks.\n2. Change the tense of the verb if necessary:\n   - Present simple → Past simple\n   - Present continuous → Past continuous\n   - Past simple → Past perfect\n   - Will → Would\n3. Adjust pronouns and time expressions:\n   - \"I\" becomes \"he\" or \"she\"\n   - \"Today\" becomes \"that day\"\n   - \"Now\" becomes \"then\"\n\n**Examples**:\n- Direct: \"I will call you tomorrow,\" he said.\n- Reported: He said he would call me the next day.\n\n**Common Reporting Verbs**:\n- Say / Says\n- Tell / Told\n- Ask / Asked\n- Explain / Explained\n\nRemember, choosing the right reporting verb can add clarity and tone to your sentences.\n\nWith practice, you will confidently convert any direct speech into reported speech, making your American English sound more natural and polished.",
