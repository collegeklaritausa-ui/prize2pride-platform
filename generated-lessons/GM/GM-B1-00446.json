  "content": "Prepositions are small but mighty words that establish relationships in a sentence, indicating location, direction, time, and other abstract connections. In American English, prepositions are essential for clarity and precision.\n\nCommon prepositions include: in, on, at, by, with, about, for, to, from, under, over, between.\n\nExamples:\n- Location: The keys are in the drawer.\n- Direction: She is going to the store.\n- Time: The meeting is at 3 PM.\n\nPrepositional phrases add detail: \n- The cat slept under the warm blanket.\n- We traveled across the country.\n\nNote: Pay attention to prepositions that sometimes cause confusion, such as 'on' vs. 'in' (e.g., in a city vs. on a street), and ensure their correct usage based on context.\n\nRemember, prepositions often have idiomatic use in American English, so exposure and practice are key to mastery.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, prepositions are often used idiomatically, especially in everyday speech and media. For example, expressions like 'on time' (punctual), 'in charge of' (responsible), and 'at ease' (comfortable) showcase the nuanced use of prepositions. Understanding these idiomatic uses enhances natural communication and helps students sound more fluent and culturally aware.",
