  "content": "Welcome to the pinnacle of American English mastery—the Passive Voice. While often viewed as complex, mastering the passive voice elevates your linguistic versatility. In active sentences, the subject performs the action: 'The chef cooks the meal.' However, in passive constructions, the focus shifts to the action's recipient or the action itself. \n\n**Formation of Passive Voice:**\n- Identify the object of the active sentence.\n- Use the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' (am, is, are, was, were, be, been) according to the tense.\n- Follow with the past participle of the main verb.\n- Optionally, include the agent with 'by'.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Active: The students completed the project.\n- Passive: The project was completed by the students.\n\n**Transforming Active to Passive:**\n1. Find the object.\n2. Make it the subject.\n3. Use the correct form of 'to be' in the same tense.\n4. Add the past participle of the verb.\n5. (Optional) Add the agent with 'by'.\n\n**Practice Examples:**\n- Active: The company will launch the new product.\n- Passive: The new product will be launched by the company.\n\nRemember, passive voice is especially useful when the doer is unknown, unimportant, or you want to emphasize the action or recipient. Use it judiciously to add sophistication and clarity to your communication.\n\nIn American English, passive voice is prevalent in formal writing, journalism, and scientific reports, where objectivity and emphasis are paramount.",
