  "content": "Prepositions are essential building blocks of clear and effective communication in American English. They establish relationships between different parts of a sentence, providing context and detail. For example, in the sentence 'The keys are **on** the counter,' the preposition 'on' links 'keys' and 'counter,' indicating location.\n\nPrepositions can be categorized based on their function:\n\n- **Place/Location:** in, on, at, beside, under, over, between\n- **Time:** before, after, during, at, since, until\n- **Direction/Movement:** to, into, onto, out of, toward, through\n- **Other relationships:** with, about, of, for, by\n\nUsing prepositions correctly involves understanding their specific relationships and choosing the most accurate one based on context. For instance, you wouldn't say 'He is good **in** math,' but rather 'He is good **at** math.'\n\nPrepositional phrases can be flexible and descriptive. They add depth to your sentences: 'She walked **along the beach**, **through the park**, and **past the old church**.'\n\nRemember, prepositions are often tricky because many look similar but have different nuances. Practice and experience are key to mastery.",
