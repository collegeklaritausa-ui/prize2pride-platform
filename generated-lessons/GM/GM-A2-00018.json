  "content": "Welcome to the world of verb tenses! In American English, using the correct verb tense is essential for clear communication. Let's start with the basics:\n\n1. Present Tense:\n- Used for actions happening now or regularly.\n- Example: I eat breakfast every day.\n\n2. Past Tense:\n- Used for actions completed in the past.\n- Example: I watched a movie yesterday.\n\n3. Future Tense:\n- Used for actions that will happen later.\n- Example: I will call you tomorrow.\n\nRegular verbs form the past tense by adding '-ed' (walk -> walked). Irregular verbs have special past tense forms (go -> went, have -> had).\n\nPractice helps! Think about your daily routine. Use the present tense to describe what you do, the past tense to talk about what you did yesterday, and the future tense for plans.\n\nRemember, mastering these tenses will make your American English sound natural and confident!",
