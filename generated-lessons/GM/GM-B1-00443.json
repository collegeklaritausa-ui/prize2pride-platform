  "content": "Prepositions are essential components of English grammar that connect nouns or pronouns to other words in a sentence, providing context such as location, direction, time, or relationship. Mastery of prepositions enhances clarity and fluency in your speech and writing.\n\n**Common Prepositions:**\n- Location: in, on, at, under, between, among\n- Direction: to, toward, into, onto, out of\n- Time: at, on, in, during, before, after\n- Other relationships: of, with, about, for, from\n\n**Usage Tips:**\n- Prepositions are always followed by a noun or pronoun.\n- Prepositional phrases add detail: \"The keys are *on the kitchen counter*\".\n- Be aware of common prepositional errors, such as ending sentences with a preposition (e.g., \"Where are you at?\" should be \"Where are you?\").\n\n**Examples:**\n- Correct: She arrived *at* the station *before* noon.\n- Incorrect: She arrived *the station before* noon. (Missing the preposition *at*)\n- Correct: The dog is *under* the table.\n- Incorrect: The dog is *the table under*.\n\nBy mastering prepositions, you'll be able to specify locations, durations, and relationships precisely, making your communication more effective and natural.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, prepositions often reflect casual speech patterns. For example, Americans frequently say \"Meet me on Main Street\" rather than \"at the main street,\" emphasizing the importance of prepositions in everyday communication. Using prepositions correctly aligns with American social norms, making your speech sound more natural and confident. Additionally, understanding regional differences—such as saying \"in the weekend\" in some dialects versus \"over the weekend\"—can help you connect better with diverse American audiences.",
