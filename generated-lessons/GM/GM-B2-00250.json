  "content": "In American English, the passive voice is a vital grammatical tool that shifts focus from the doer to the receiver of an action. Typically, it forms with the appropriate form of 'to be' plus the past participle of the main verb. For example, active: 'The chef cooked the meal.' Passive: 'The meal was cooked by the chef.' The passive voice is especially useful when the doer is unknown, irrelevant, or we want to emphasize the action or recipient. It’s common in formal writing, news reports, and scientific contexts.\n\nTo identify passive voice, look for a form of 'to be' (am, is, are, was, were, be, been, being) followed by a past participle. To convert active to passive:\n1. Move the object of the active sentence to the subject position.\n2. Use the correct form of 'to be' matching the original verb's tense.\n3. Add 'by' + the original subject (if necessary).\n\nExample:\nActive: The team will complete the project.\nPassive: The project will be completed by the team.\n\nRemember, overusing passive voice can make sentences less direct and more complex. Use it judiciously to enhance clarity and style.\n\nIn American English, passive constructions are common in official documents, scientific writing, and news media, where objectivity and focus on results are valued.",

  "culturalNotes": "In American culture, clarity and directness are valued, especially in professional and casual communication. Mastery of passive voice allows speakers and writers to emphasize the action or recipient, which is often preferred in formal reporting, journalism, and academic writing. Understanding when and how to use the passive is crucial for effective communication in diverse American contexts, from business to media. Recognizing passive constructions also helps in interpreting news reports and scientific articles, where objectivity and focus on results are prioritized.",
