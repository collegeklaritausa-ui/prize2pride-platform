## Unit 1: Hello, America!

### Unit Overview
This opening unit introduces learners to the English alphabet, basic greetings, and self-introduction patterns. Students will learn to recognize and produce English sounds, spell their names, and engage in simple greeting exchanges.

### Lesson 1.1: The English Alphabet
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
Students will recognize and pronounce all 26 letters of the English alphabet, understand the difference between vowels and consonants, and begin to associate letters with their most common sounds.

**Core Content:**
The English alphabet consists of 26 letters, divided into vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (the remaining 21 letters). Each letter has a name and one or more sounds it can represent. In American English, certain letter sounds differ from British English, particularly the letter "R" which has a distinctive rhotic quality.

**Vocabulary Focus:**

| Letter | Name | Example Word | Pronunciation |
|--------|------|--------------|---------------|
| A | /eɪ/ | Apple | /ˈæpəl/ |
| B | /biː/ | Book | /bʊk/ |
| C | /siː/ | Cat | /kæt/ |
| D | /diː/ | Dog | /dɔːɡ/ |
| E | /iː/ | Egg | /eɡ/ |

**Practice Activities:**
The lesson includes alphabet recognition games, letter-sound matching exercises, and spelling practice with common words. Students will practice writing both uppercase and lowercase letters while listening to native speaker pronunciation.

**Cultural Note:**
Americans frequently spell out words, especially names, over the phone or in professional settings. The phrase "Can you spell that for me?" is commonly used in everyday interactions.

---

### Lesson 1.2: Greetings and Introductions
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
Students will learn formal and informal greeting expressions, practice introducing themselves, and understand appropriate greeting customs in American culture.

**Core Content:**
Greetings in American English vary based on formality, time of day, and relationship between speakers. Americans typically use first names even in semi-formal situations, which differs from many other cultures where titles and surnames are preferred.

**Essential Expressions:**

| Situation | Formal | Informal |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Meeting someone | "How do you do?" | "Hey, what's up?" |
| Morning greeting | "Good morning" | "Morning!" |
| Afternoon greeting | "Good afternoon" | "Hey there!" |
| Evening greeting | "Good evening" | "Hi!" |
| Farewell | "Goodbye" | "See ya!" |

**Dialogue Practice:**
```
Person A: Hi! I'm Sarah. What's your name?
Person B: Hello, Sarah. I'm Michael. Nice to meet you.
Person A: Nice to meet you too, Michael. Where are you from?
Person B: I'm from California. How about you?
Person A: I'm from New York.
```

**Cultural Note:**
Americans often accompany greetings with a firm handshake and direct eye contact. A smile is expected and considered a sign of friendliness. The question "How are you?" is typically a greeting rather than a genuine inquiry about one's well-being, and the expected response is "Fine, thanks" or "Good, how are you?"

### Lesson 1.3: Numbers 1-100
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
Students will count from 1 to 100, recognize written numerals and their word forms, and use numbers in practical contexts such as phone numbers, addresses, and prices.

| 21-99 | Tens + ones | twenty-one, thirty-five |

**Practical Applications:**
The lesson covers using numbers for phone numbers (Americans say digits individually: "five-five-five, one-two-three-four"), addresses (house numbers followed by street names), prices (dollars and cents), and ages.

**Practice Exercises:**
Students will practice dictation exercises with phone numbers, complete number sequences, and role-play scenarios involving prices and quantities.

**AM vs. PM:**
AM (ante meridiem) refers to times from midnight to noon, while PM (post meridiem) covers noon to midnight. Americans typically specify AM or PM to avoid confusion.

"What time is it?" and "Do you have the time?" are standard ways to ask for the current time. Responses typically include "It's..." followed by the time.
